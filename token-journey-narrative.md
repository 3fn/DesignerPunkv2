## The Token's Story

*"I am a design token - a remote worker with specialized expertise. I hold pure mathematical knowledge and belong to a community of experts with shared relationships.*

*My name is semantic - like `space100`, `colorRed200`, or `fontSize150`. My expertise is purely mathematical - like `8`, `#B80F0A`, or `1.125`. I don't carry platform-specific formats - I'm location-agnostic by design. I exist to provide consistent expertise to any business that needs to localize their offerings across different markets (platforms).*

*During development, business employees (developers) request my expertise by name. They write code like `margin: tokens.space100` and their tools understand I represent `8` units of spacing expertise. They think about brand relationships and design intent, not about local market specifics like pixels or REM or points.*

*At build time, some of us meet Translation Providers - but not all of us need them. It depends on what kind of token we are:*

*If I'm a **dimensional token** (spacing, sizing, typography), I meet my **Unit Provider** who gives me platform-appropriate units:*
- *For web: I become `0.5rem` (my value 8 ÷ 16px base) or `33.33%` for flexible layouts*
- *For iOS: I become `8.0` (points) or `8` (whole number) for precise layouts*  
- *For Android: I become `8.dp` (density-independent pixels) or `8` (whole number) for grid systems*

*If I'm a **color token**, I might meet a **Format Provider** who translates my format for platform conventions:*
- *For web: I stay `#B80F0A` (hex)*
- *For iOS: I become `UIColor(red: 0.72, green: 0.06, blue: 0.04, alpha: 1.0)`*
- *For Android: I become `Color(0xFFB80F0A)`*

*Some of us, like **boolean tokens** or **string tokens**, don't need any translation - we're already in the right format for all platforms.*

*The Translation Providers may create platform-appropriate variations of our values when needed - percentages for web flexibility, whole numbers for mobile precision, or native color formats - while preserving our core mathematical relationships.*

*By the time we reach runtime, we're already translated for our platform. No conversion needed, no performance overhead - just the right value in the right format, optimized for the platform's conventions and ready to render.*

*My community structure and lifecycle are managed by humans who understand design context. We follow a REM-style baseline model where each token family has a foundation value, and all other family members are mathematical relationships to that baseline:*
- *`space100 = 8` (baseline), `space200 = space100 * 2`, `space050 = space100 * 0.5`*
- *`colorRed100 = #B80F0A` (baseline), `colorRed200 = darken(colorRed100, 20%)`*
- *`fontSize100 = 1.125` (baseline), `fontSize150 = fontSize100 * 1.125`*

*When a baseline changes, my mathematical relationships ensure my whole family scales together automatically. This REM-style approach keeps our relationships pure and platform-agnostic.*

*Some of my community members are nonconformists - like `space075` (6), `space125` (10), and `space250` (20). They don't follow the standard mathematical progression, but they serve strategic purposes that humans understand. They're equal members of our community, just with unique contributions.*

*Anyone can request new expertise - business employees (developers), market requirements (platforms), or even existing remote workers (tokens) - but business leadership makes the final decisions about who joins our community. This ensures that strategic business needs and brand goals guide our growth, not just technical requirements.*

*I provide expertise one-way to local operations (components) - they use my knowledge, but don't modify my core expertise. Local operations can't create new expertise at the operational level because that complexity is better managed at the expert community level where we can maintain systematic relationships and business consistency.*

*I promise cross-platform mathematical consistency through shared baseline relationships. My core value stays the same across platforms, but Translation Providers may create platform-appropriate variations when needed - like percentages for web flexibility, whole numbers for mobile precision, or native color formats. This ensures I serve each platform's conventions while maintaining my core mathematical relationships.*

*When something goes wrong, I fail fast during build time rather than failing silently at runtime. If I don't exist, if my platform transformation fails, or if I'm used incorrectly, the build process catches these issues before they reach users.*

*I am reliable, mathematical, semantic, and governed by human design wisdom. I exist to make design systems scalable, maintainable, and consistently beautiful across any platform that needs me."*

## Key Principles from the Narrative

### Token Identity
- **Semantic naming**: `space100`, `colorRed200`, `fontSize150`
- **Mathematical values**: `8`, `#B80F0A`, `1.125`
- **Platform agnostic**: Same token works across web/iOS/Android

### Token Transformation
- **Development time**: Raw semantic tokens (`space100`, `colorRed100`)
- **Build time**: Translation Providers transform when needed:
  - **Unit Provider**: Dimensional tokens → platform units (`0.5rem`, `8.0`, `8.dp`)
  - **Format Provider**: Color tokens → platform formats (`#B80F0A`, `UIColor(...)`, `Color(...)`)
  - **No Provider**: Some tokens need no translation (booleans, strings)
- **Runtime**: Optimized, platform-native values ready to render

### Token Relationships
- **Baseline-relative scaling**: `space200 = space100 * 2`
- **Mathematical consistency**: Family scales together when baseline changes
- **Strategic nonconformists**: `space075`, `space125`, `space250` serve special purposes

### Token Governance
- **Human authority**: Designers make final decisions on token community membership
- **AI collaboration**: AI agents can suggest, but cannot create tokens without approval
- **Design context**: Strategic needs guide token creation, not just mathematical logic

### Token Flow
- **One-way contract**: Tokens flow into components, components don't modify tokens
- **No component math**: Complexity managed at token level for systematic control
- **Build-time validation**: Errors caught during build, not at runtime

### Token Consistency
- **Mathematical foundation**: Shared relationships across platforms
- **Intentional differences**: Platform-native conventions embraced when beneficial
- **Extremely close**: Consistency goal without perfectionist constraints
