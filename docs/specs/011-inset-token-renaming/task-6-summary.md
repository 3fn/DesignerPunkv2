# Task 6 Summary: Update Documentation and Migration Guide

**Date**: November 26, 2025  
**Spec**: 011-inset-token-renaming  
**Type**: Implementation

---

## What Was Done

Created comprehensive documentation ecosystem for inset token renaming, including migration guide with complete mapping tables, spacing tokens guide with mathematical relationships, and verified component documentation completeness. All documentation explains numeric naming convention, provides before/after examples, and documents rationale for the change.

## Why It Matters

Enables successful migration from subjective token names to numeric names by providing clear guidance, complete mapping tables, and comprehensive examples. Documentation serves multiple audiences (developers, AI agents, design system maintainers) and establishes patterns for future token changes.

## Key Changes

- Created migration guide with complete mapping tables, step-by-step process, and troubleshooting
- Created spacing tokens guide documenting numeric naming convention and mathematical relationships
- Verified component documentation completeness with Token Consumption sections
- Documented rationale (mathematical transparency, AI-friendly, proportion reasoning)
- Provided platform-specific examples (CSS, Swift, Kotlin)

## Impact

- ✅ Developers have single source of truth for migration guidance
- ✅ Spacing tokens guide serves as definitive reference for all spacing tokens
- ✅ Component documentation shows practical usage of numeric token names
- ✅ AI agents can navigate documentation through clear structure and cross-references
- ✅ Design system maintainers understand rationale through documented design decisions
