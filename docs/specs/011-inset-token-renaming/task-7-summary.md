# Task 7 Summary: Final Verification Complete

**Date**: November 26, 2025
**Spec**: 011-inset-token-renaming
**Type**: Implementation

---

## What Was Done

Completed comprehensive final verification of the inset token renaming implementation. Verified that all tests pass, build succeeds, no old token name references remain, visual appearance is unchanged, and documentation is complete. All success criteria met with evidence.

## Why It Matters

Final verification ensures the inset token renaming is production-ready with no regressions. The systematic verification across build, tests, codebase search, visual regression, and documentation provides high confidence that the breaking change is clean and complete.

## Key Changes

- Verified all tests passing (semantic tokens, components, platform generators)
- Confirmed build succeeds with no TypeScript errors
- Validated no old token name references (except migration guide)
- Ensured visual appearance unchanged (pixel values identical)
- Confirmed documentation complete (migration guide, token docs, component docs)

## Impact

- ✅ Production-ready inset token system with numeric names
- ✅ Mathematical transparency enables proportion reasoning
- ✅ AI-friendly "inset" prefix provides clear context
- ✅ Type safety enforced through TypeScript
- ✅ Cross-platform consistency verified
- ✅ Clean migration with comprehensive documentation
