# Task 4 Summary: A2UI Validation & Documentation

**Date**: 2026-02-28
**Spec**: 064 - Component Metadata Schema

## What Was Done

- A2UI v0.9 mapping exercise: field-by-field mapping of 3 representative components found 0 schema omissions — all gaps are renderer bridge concerns
- Data contracts pause point: deferred to v2 (only 2 of 28 components have complex data shapes, threshold is 3)
- Schema format reference documentation: all assembled JSON fields documented with progressive disclosure tiers
- MCP query interface documentation: all 6 tools documented with parameters and example responses
- Contract-System-Reference.md reviewed: no changes needed — 064 consumes contract conventions without modifying them
- Data shapes governance doc created for future escalation when trigger criteria are met
