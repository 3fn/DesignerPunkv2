**Date**: November 30, 2025
**Spec**: 010-container-component
**Type**: Implementation

---

## What Was Done

Created comprehensive documentation and examples for the Container component, including a 1,200+ line README with complete API reference, visual prop comparison examples, semantic component examples (Card and Panel), and updated the Component Development Guide with nested Container anti-patterns.

## Why It Matters

Complete documentation enables developers to understand and use Container effectively, provides visual examples that demonstrate prop differences, shows how to build semantic components using Container, and prevents common mistakes through anti-pattern guidance. This documentation serves as the authoritative reference for Container usage across all platforms.

## Key Changes

- Created comprehensive Container README with all sections (overview, usage, API reference, token consumption, nested containers, platform-specific notes, accessibility, troubleshooting)
- Created BasicUsage.html demonstrating minimal to complex Container patterns
- Created PropsReference.html with visual comparisons of padding, border, borderRadius, and layering props
- Created Card.tsx and Panel.tsx semantic component examples showing compositional architecture
- Updated Component Development Guide with nested Container anti-patterns section

## Impact

- ✅ Developers have comprehensive reference documentation for Container
- ✅ Visual examples demonstrate prop differences clearly
- ✅ Semantic component examples show proper Container usage patterns
- ✅ Anti-pattern guidance prevents common nested Container mistakes
- ✅ Documentation follows established format with AI Agent warnings
- ✅ Cross-references enable easy navigation between related documentation
