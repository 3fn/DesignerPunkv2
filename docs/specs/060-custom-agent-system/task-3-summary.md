# Task 3 Summary: Create Ada System Prompt

**Date**: 2026-02-14
**Spec**: 060 — Custom Agent System (Ada)
**Task**: 3. Create Ada System Prompt
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 060-custom-agent-system

---

## What

Completed Ada's system prompt (`.kiro/agents/ada-prompt.md`) with all required sections: identity, domain boundaries with response examples, domain respect collaboration model, ballot measure documentation governance, token governance autonomy levels, MCP usage patterns with specific doc paths, and AI-Collaboration-Principles compliance.

## Why

Ada needs a well-defined system prompt to operate as a focused Rosetta token specialist — knowing her domain, respecting boundaries with Lina and Thurgood, following governance rules, and querying the right MCP docs.

## Impact

- Ada is now fully configured with both `ada.json` (Task 2) and `ada-prompt.md` (Task 3)
- Agent invocation references use correct keyboard shortcuts (`ctrl+shift+l`, `ctrl+shift+t`)
- Interactive behavioral validation deferred to Peter for manual testing
