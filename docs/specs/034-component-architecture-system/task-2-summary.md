# Task 2 Summary: Existing Component Audit Complete

**Date**: 2026-01-01
**Purpose**: Concise summary of parent task completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 034-component-architecture-system

## What Was Done

Completed comprehensive audit of 4 existing components (ButtonCTA, Container, TextInputField, Icon) for Stemma System compliance. Documented 11 critical findings across naming conventions and behavioral contracts. Created detailed remediation recommendations and obtained Human approval for full remediation scope.

## Why It Matters

This audit establishes the foundation for migrating existing components to Stemma System compliance. The approved remediation scope enables systematic component migration with test-first methodology, ensuring the Stemma System patterns are validated before broader application.

## Key Changes

- Audited 4 components across web, iOS, and Android platforms
- Documented 11 critical findings (naming, contracts) and 2 non-critical findings
- Created remediation recommendations with 15-20 hour effort estimate
- Obtained Human approval for full remediation scope
- Established test-first approach with TextInputField as validation

## Impact

- ✅ Clear path to Stemma System compliance for all existing components
- ✅ 28 implicit behavioral contracts identified for formalization
- ✅ Approved migration order: TextInputField → ButtonCTA → Container → Icon
- ✅ Risk mitigated through test-first methodology
