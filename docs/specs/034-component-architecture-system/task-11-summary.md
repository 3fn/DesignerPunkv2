# Task 11 Summary: Component Family Development Standards

**Date**: 2026-01-02
**Purpose**: Concise summary of parent task completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 034-component-architecture-system

## What Was Done

Created comprehensive Component Family Development Standards for the Stemma System, providing everything needed to create new component families systematically.

## Why It Matters

Enables consistent, high-quality component family development by providing:
- Clear step-by-step process for AI agents and developers
- Ready-to-use templates eliminating guesswork
- Formal validation ensuring Stemma System compliance
- Review process maintaining architectural integrity

## Key Changes

- Created `.kiro/steering/component-family-development-standards.md` with 6-phase creation process
- Created `.kiro/steering/component-family-templates.md` with schema, inheritance, and contract templates
- Established 57-item validation checklist across 4 phases
- Defined 5-stage formal review process with Human-AI checkpoints
- Documented integration requirements for all Stemma System infrastructure

## Impact

- ✅ AI agents can create new component families following documented process
- ✅ Templates reduce development time and ensure consistency
- ✅ Validation checklist catches issues before production
- ✅ Review process ensures Human oversight at critical stages
- ✅ Integration requirements ensure new families work with existing infrastructure
