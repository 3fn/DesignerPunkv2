# Task 1 Summary: Stemma System Foundation

**Date**: 2026-01-01
**Purpose**: Concise summary of parent task completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 034-component-architecture-system

## What Was Done

Established the Stemma System foundation—a relational component architecture that complements the existing Rosetta System (mathematical token foundation). Created comprehensive documentation for systematic component development across web, iOS, and Android platforms.

## Why It Matters

The Stemma System enables:
- **AI-optimal component discovery** through predictable [Family]-[Type]-[Variant] naming
- **Cross-platform behavioral consistency** through explicit contracts
- **Systematic component organization** through family inheritance patterns
- **Clear component maturity communication** through readiness status indicators

## Key Changes

- Created Stemma System principles document with governance guidelines (~860 lines)
- Established component schema format specification with YAML structure (~1,055 lines)
- Defined readiness status system (Production Ready, Beta, Placeholder, Deprecated)
- Documented primitive vs semantic usage philosophy (distinct from token philosophy)
- Documented all 11 component families with inheritance structures

## Impact

- ✅ Foundation established for systematic component development
- ✅ AI agents can now discover components through predictable naming patterns
- ✅ Cross-platform behavioral contracts ensure consistent user experiences
- ✅ Clear governance guidelines prevent architectural drift
- ✅ Rosetta + Stemma integration provides complete design system foundation
