# Task 12 Summary: Test Development Standards Update

**Date**: 2026-01-02
**Purpose**: Concise summary of parent task completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 034-component-architecture-system

## What Was Done

Updated Test Development Standards with comprehensive Stemma System linting integration, establishing a dual validation approach that combines static analysis with dynamic testing for complete component validation.

## Why It Matters

Developers now have clear guidance on when to use linting versus testing, reducing validation gaps and ensuring consistent component quality across the codebase. The integrated workflows provide step-by-step processes for common development scenarios.

## Key Changes

- Added "Linting and Testing Integration" section with decision framework
- Created 4 complete workflow examples (new component, migration, integration, cross-platform)
- Added workflow summary table and quick reference commands
- Integrated Test Development Standards into meta-guide as MCP-queryable document

## Impact

- ✅ Clear validation type selection guidance (linting vs testing)
- ✅ Dual validation approach documented for comprehensive coverage
- ✅ Practical workflow examples for common development tasks
- ✅ Quick reference commands for efficient validation operations
