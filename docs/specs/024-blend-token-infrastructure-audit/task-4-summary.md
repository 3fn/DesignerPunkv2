# Task 4 Summary: Phase 4 Deliverables & Clean Exit

**Date**: December 28, 2025
**Purpose**: Concise summary of Phase 4 completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 024-blend-token-infrastructure-audit

## What Was Done

Completed Phase 4 of the Blend Token Infrastructure Audit, producing all final deliverables:
- Created design-outline for Spec 031-blend-infrastructure-implementation
- Produced comprehensive implementation recommendations
- Verified clean exit with all issues explicitly addressed
- Confirmed consistency across all 16 findings documents

## Why It Matters

The audit is now complete with a clear implementation path. Spec 031 can proceed with full context from the audit findings, ensuring blend token infrastructure is built correctly the first time.

## Key Changes

- Created `.kiro/specs/031-blend-infrastructure-implementation/design-outline.md` defining implementation scope
- Created `findings/implementation-recommendations.md` with phased approach (7-11 days)
- Created `findings/clean-exit-summary.md` verifying no issues silently ignored
- Verified all 46 artifacts are complete and consistent

## Impact

- ✅ Audit complete - all 4 phases finished with human checkpoint approval
- ✅ Clear implementation path - Spec 031 ready for development
- ✅ 9 gaps to implement, 0 deferred, 1 closed (already complete)
- ✅ Foundation ready for volume component production
