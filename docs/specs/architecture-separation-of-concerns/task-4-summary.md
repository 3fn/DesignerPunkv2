# Task 4 Summary: Document Registry-Validator Interaction Pattern and Update Documentation

**Date**: November 9, 2025
**Spec**: architecture-separation-of-concerns
**Type**: Implementation

---

## What Was Done

Created comprehensive documentation for the registry-validator interaction pattern and updated all related documentation to reflect the new separation of concerns architecture. This includes a definitive pattern guide, migration guide, and updates to audit documents and system overview.

## Why It Matters

Provides clear, unambiguous guidance for developers and AI agents on how to correctly use validators and registries. Ensures the architectural refactoring is properly documented and enables consistent implementation across the codebase.

## Key Changes

- **Created Registry-Validator Pattern Document**: Comprehensive guide with usage examples, pattern considerations, anti-patterns, and AI agent guidelines (1,200+ lines)
- **Created Migration Guide**: Step-by-step migration patterns for all common scenarios with before/after code examples and troubleshooting (800+ lines)
- **Updated Phase 1 Audit Documents**: Marked Issues #012, #013, #014 as RESOLVED with resolution details and cross-references
- **Updated Token System Overview**: Added validation flow section, validation interfaces documentation, and cross-references to detailed guides

## Impact

- ✅ Developers have clear guidance on validation and registration patterns
- ✅ AI agents can follow pattern without human clarification
- ✅ Migration guide enables smooth transition to new architecture
- ✅ All documentation reflects new separation of concerns
- ✅ Phase 1 audit issues properly documented as resolved
- ✅ Cross-references enable efficient navigation between related documentation
