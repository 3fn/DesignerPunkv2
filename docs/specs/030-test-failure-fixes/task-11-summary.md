# Task 11 Summary: Remaining Test Failure Audit

**Date**: December 28, 2025
**Purpose**: Concise summary of parent task completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 030-test-failure-fixes

## What Was Done

Completed comprehensive audit of 16 remaining test failures discovered during Phase 5 initial verification. Each failure was categorized by root cause and assigned a confirmed fix approach based on Peter's input.

## Why It Matters

This audit provides the foundation for Task 12 implementation by:
- Identifying the exact root cause of each failure
- Confirming fix approaches with human oversight
- Distinguishing between test changes, threshold adjustments, and code fixes
- Ensuring sustainable solutions rather than quick patches

## Key Changes

- Categorized 16 failures into 3 categories: cross-platform (6), performance/timeout (6), functional (4)
- Confirmed nuanced validation approach for cross-platform token count differences
- Documented threshold and timeout increases with justification
- Identified cache implementation issues requiring code fixes

## Impact

- ✅ All remaining failures now have documented root causes
- ✅ Fix approaches confirmed with Peter's input
- ✅ Task 12 subtasks defined with clear implementation guidance
- ✅ Sustainable solutions prioritized over quick fixes
