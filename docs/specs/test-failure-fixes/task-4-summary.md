# Task 4 Summary: Update Validation Test Expectations

**Date**: November 22, 2025
**Spec**: test-failure-fixes
**Type**: Implementation

---

## What Was Done

Investigated 7 validation expectation failures in EndToEndWorkflow.test.ts and discovered all tests are already passing. Previous tasks (Tasks 2-3) had indirectly resolved the validation issues, making test updates unnecessary. Documented current validation behavior comprehensively.

## Why It Matters

Confirms the test suite is healthy and validation expectations are accurate. Demonstrates that comprehensive fixes can resolve issues beyond their immediate scope. Provides documented baseline of current validation behavior for future reference.

## Key Changes

- Investigated all 7 EndToEndWorkflow.test.ts validation failures
- Confirmed all tests now passing (resolved by Tasks 2-3)
- Documented current validation behavior (baseline grid, mathematical relationships, references)
- Marked Task 4.2 complete without changes (not needed)

## Impact

- ✅ All 7 validation expectation failures resolved
- ✅ Test expectations confirmed to match current validation behavior
- ✅ Validation system comprehensively documented
- ✅ End-to-end workflow validation restored and verified
- ✅ Demonstrates cascading benefits of comprehensive fixes
