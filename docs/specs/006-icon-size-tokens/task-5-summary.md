# Task 5 Summary: Icon Size Token Documentation

**Date**: November 18, 2025
**Spec**: 006-icon-size-tokens
**Type**: Implementation

---

## What Was Done

Completed comprehensive documentation for icon size tokens in the Icon component README, including all 8 unique sizes (13, 18, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48), the `fontSize × lineHeight` formula, typography pairing guidance, core vs available sizes distinction, and detailed AI agent reasoning examples with calculation breakdowns and adaptability scenarios.

## Why It Matters

Provides clear, systematic guidance for both human developers and AI agents on icon size selection, enabling reliable icon-typography pairing through mathematical relationships. The documentation establishes the foundation for AI-friendly design system collaboration by making the formula explicit and providing detailed reasoning paths.

## Key Changes

- Updated Icon README with comprehensive size variants table showing all 8 unique sizes with typography pairings and 4pt alignment status
- Documented `fontSize × lineHeight` formula with detailed explanation and rationale
- Created core vs available sizes guidance (90% vs 10% use cases) with practical recommendations
- Added typography pairing section with detailed table and 5 real-world examples (buttons, headings, captions)
- Documented optical balance rationale explaining why icons fill line height space
- Created comprehensive AI agent reasoning section with 5 detailed calculation examples, decision tree, adaptability scenarios, and anti-patterns
- Added formula validation checklist and quick reference tables for systematic icon size selection

## Impact

- ✅ Human developers can select appropriate icon sizes based on typography context
- ✅ AI agents can reason systematically about icon size selection using explicit formula
- ✅ Documentation supports both learning (detailed examples) and reference (quick tables) use cases
- ✅ Mathematical foundation enables automatic adaptation when typography scales change
- ✅ Core vs available sizes distinction reduces cognitive load and focuses on common use cases
- ✅ Anti-patterns section prevents common mistakes in icon size selection
