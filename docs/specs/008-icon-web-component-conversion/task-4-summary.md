# Task 4 Summary: Update Documentation

**Date**: November 20, 2025
**Spec**: 008-icon-web-component-conversion
**Type**: Implementation

---

## What Was Done

Updated Icon component documentation with comprehensive web component usage guide, migration guide from functional API to web component API, interactive HTML examples demonstrating all features, and platform-specific implementation details explaining True Native Architecture.

## Why It Matters

Complete documentation enables developers to successfully adopt the new `<dp-icon>` web component API, migrate from the legacy functional API at their own pace, and understand the cross-platform architecture. Interactive examples provide hands-on learning experience that reduces friction and accelerates adoption.

## Key Changes

- Added "Web Component Usage" section to README with comprehensive API documentation (attributes, properties, Shadow DOM, lifecycle hooks)
- Created "Migration Guide" section with side-by-side comparisons of old vs new usage for all common use cases
- Created WebComponentUsage.html with 8 interactive example sections demonstrating basic usage, size variants, color inheritance, and programmatic manipulation
- Added "Platform Implementations" section documenting True Native Architecture and platform-specific details for web, iOS, and Android

## Impact

- ✅ Developers can learn web component API from comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Developers can migrate from functional API using clear migration guide with side-by-side examples
- ✅ Developers can experiment with interactive examples to understand behavior
- ✅ Developers understand cross-platform architecture and platform-specific implementations
- ✅ Documentation covers all common use cases with copy-paste examples
