# Task 9 Summary: Audit Small Root Documents

**Date**: 2025-12-30
**Purpose**: Concise summary of parent task completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 032-documentation-architecture-audit

## What Was Done

Audited the two small root documents in `docs/` (700 lines total) to assess relevance, currency, and optimal disposition.

## Why It Matters

Completes the audit of all root-level documentation, ensuring no valuable content is overlooked and no unnecessary files remain.

## Key Changes

- Assessed `platform-conventions-guide.md` (412 lines) - historical/explanatory documentation
- Assessed `performance-baseline.md` (288 lines) - performance reference data
- Both confirmed for retention as-is

## Impact

- ✅ Both small root docs have documented disposition decisions
- ✅ No consolidation actions required for Task 10
- ✅ Audit of all `docs/` content now complete (Tasks 1-9)
