# Task 1 Summary: Audit docs/tokens/ Directory

**Date**: 2025-12-30
**Purpose**: Concise summary of parent task completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 032-documentation-architecture-audit

## What Was Done

Completed comprehensive audit of the `docs/tokens/` directory (11 files) to assess coverage gaps, redundancy with steering/MCP documentation, and consolidation opportunities. Followed two-phase workflow: Draft Findings → Human Review → Confirmed Actions.

## Why It Matters

- Identifies 2 empty files for removal (reducing clutter)
- Recommends 9 valuable token reference docs for MCP integration (improving AI agent access)
- Establishes cross-reference patterns between token docs and steering guidance
- Standardizes metadata across token documentation

## Key Changes

- Audited all 11 files in `docs/tokens/` (~5,200 lines)
- Created draft findings with per-file disposition recommendations
- Obtained human confirmation on all recommendations
- Documented actions for Task 10 (Consolidation) execution

## Confirmed Dispositions

| Action | Files | Count |
|--------|-------|-------|
| REMOVE | token-validation-guide.md, token-validation-rules.md | 2 |
| RETAIN (MCP) | All substantive token docs | 9 |

## Impact

- ✅ All 11 files have documented disposition decisions
- ✅ Empty files verified as unreferenced (removal confirmed)
- ✅ MCP candidacy assessed for all valuable token documentation
- ✅ Human reviewed and confirmed all recommendations
- ✅ Actions queued for Task 10 (Consolidation) execution
