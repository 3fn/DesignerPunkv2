# Task 4 Summary: Create Documentation and Guidance

**Date**: January 10, 2025
**Spec**: responsive-layout-system
**Type**: Implementation

---

## What Was Done

Created comprehensive documentation and guidance for the responsive layout system, including four detailed guides covering semantic grid vs spacing token selection, platform-specific component sizing syntax, component-level sizing token guidance, and web responsive grid usage patterns.

## Why It Matters

Provides developers with clear, actionable guidance for implementing responsive layouts and sizing components across platforms. The documentation enables systematic token selection, demonstrates True Native Architecture principles, and provides complete real-world examples that developers can adapt to their specific needs.

## Key Changes

- Created semantic-grid-vs-spacing-guide.md with decision framework for token selection
- Created platform-component-sizing-guide.md with examples for web (Lit), iOS (SwiftUI), and Android (Compose)
- Created component-sizing-token-guide.md explaining token creation and elevation process
- Enhanced responsive-grid-usage.md with CSS custom properties, media queries, and complete layout examples

## Impact

- ✅ Clear token selection guidance eliminates ambiguity in choosing between grid and spacing tokens
- ✅ Platform-specific examples demonstrate True Native Architecture with same mathematical relationships
- ✅ Component token guidance enables pattern discovery and systematic elevation to semantic tokens
- ✅ Complete layout examples (blog, dashboard, e-commerce, landing page) provide realistic implementation patterns
- ✅ Cross-reference network enables efficient navigation between related documentation
