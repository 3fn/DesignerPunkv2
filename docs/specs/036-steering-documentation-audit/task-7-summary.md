**Date**: 2026-01-03
**Purpose**: Concise summary of Checkpoint 2 approval
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 036-steering-documentation-audit

## What Was Done

Presented Phase 2 analysis recommendations to human for review. After detailed discussion covering Rosetta System alignment, validation tier canonical sources, and file organization slimming approaches, all recommendations were approved with refinements.

## Why It Matters

Checkpoint 2 approval establishes the execution plan for the steering documentation audit. Key decisions include:
- Rosetta System alignment included in this spec (parallel to Stemma System)
- Task-Type-Definitions becomes canonical source for validation tiers
- File Organization Standards slimmed via combined approach (~70% reduction)
- 6 prefix families approved for 43 documents

## Key Decisions

- 5 consolidation proposals approved (1 revised, 1 expanded)
- 6 prefix proposals approved with batch execution order
- File split decisions finalized (consolidation first for Dev Workflow, combined approach for File Org Standards)
- 3 new documents to create (Completion Documentation Guide, Cross-Reference Standards, rosetta-system-principles.md)

## Impact

- ✅ Phase 2 Analysis complete
- ✅ Human approval received for all recommendations
- ✅ Ready to proceed to Phase 3: Implementation Planning
