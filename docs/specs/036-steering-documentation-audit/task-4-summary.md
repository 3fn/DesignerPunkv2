# Task 4 Summary: Category Analysis

**Date**: 2026-01-03
**Purpose**: Concise summary of parent task completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 036-steering-documentation-audit

## What Was Done

Completed comprehensive category analysis of all 55 steering documents, identifying 6 document families (43 docs, 78.2%), 12 standalone documents (21.8%), and 8 edge cases requiring human decision at Checkpoint 2.

## Why It Matters

Category analysis enables systematic prefix standardization that improves document discoverability and MCP query precision while respecting the 3+ document threshold for family creation.

## Key Changes

- Identified 6 document families with proposed categorical prefixes
- Documented 12 standalone documents with rationale for standalone status
- Flagged 8 edge cases (23 documents total) requiring human decision

## Impact

- ✅ 78.2% of documents belong to identified families
- ✅ Clear prefix candidates for each family
- ✅ Edge cases documented with multiple options for human decision
- ✅ Phase 1 Discovery ready for Checkpoint 1 review
