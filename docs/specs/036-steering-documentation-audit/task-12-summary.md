# Task 12 Summary: Development Workflow Slimming

**Date**: 2026-01-03
**Purpose**: Concise summary of parent task completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 036-steering-documentation-audit

## What Was Done

Slimmed Development Workflow.md by replacing detailed content with priming + MCP query directions, reducing token count by approximately 1,800 tokens (~91% of target) while maintaining full functionality through MCP queries to canonical sources.

## Why It Matters

Reduces context load at session start while preserving access to detailed guidance through MCP queries. AI agents now get concise priming with clear directions to query canonical sources when detailed information is needed.

## Key Changes

- Replaced detailed Release Detection content with priming + MCP query to Release Management System.md
- Replaced detailed File Organization content with priming + MCP query to File Organization Standards.md
- Replaced detailed Completion Documentation content with priming + MCP query to Completion Documentation Guide.md
- Updated AI Agent Reading Priorities with MCP query directions for all three scenarios
- Validated all 10 MCP query directions work correctly

## Impact

- ✅ ~1,800 tokens removed from Development Workflow.md
- ✅ All MCP query directions validated and working
- ✅ Priming approach maintains context while reducing token load
- ✅ Canonical sources accessible via MCP for detailed guidance
