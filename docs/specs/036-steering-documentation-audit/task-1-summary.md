# Task 1 Summary: Discovery Phase Setup and Token Audit

**Date**: 2026-01-03
**Purpose**: Concise summary of parent task completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 036-steering-documentation-audit

## What Was Done

Established audit infrastructure and calculated token counts for all 55 steering documents, providing the foundation for the steering documentation audit.

## Why It Matters

Understanding the current token load is essential for making informed optimization decisions. The audit revealed that two always-loaded documents (Development Workflow and File Organization Standards) account for 83.7% of session start load, identifying clear optimization targets.

## Key Changes

- Created audit artifacts directory with tracking documents
- Calculated token counts for all 55 steering documents (281,679 total tokens)
- Identified session start load: 39,124 tokens (6 always-loaded documents)
- Documented layer distribution and optimization candidates

## Impact

- ✅ Complete visibility into steering documentation token load
- ✅ Clear optimization targets identified (two large always-loaded docs)
- ✅ Foundation established for legacy naming audit (Task 2)
- ✅ Data-driven approach to context optimization enabled
