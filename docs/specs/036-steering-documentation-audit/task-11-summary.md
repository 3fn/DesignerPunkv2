# Task 11 Summary: Batch 1 - New Document Creation

**Date**: 2026-01-03
**Purpose**: Concise summary of parent task completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 036-steering-documentation-audit

## What Was Done

Created three new steering documents to support the documentation audit: Completion Documentation Guide (consolidates completion doc guidance), Process-Cross-Reference-Standards (consolidates cross-reference guidance), and rosetta-system-principles.md (establishes token architecture principles parallel to Stemma System).

## Why It Matters

These documents establish canonical sources for previously scattered guidance, reducing redundancy in File Organization Standards and Development Workflow while providing architectural symmetry between token (Rosetta) and component (Stemma) systems.

## Key Changes

- Created `Completion Documentation Guide.md` (~3,001 tokens)
- Created `Process-Cross-Reference-Standards.md` (~6,391 tokens)
- Created `rosetta-system-principles.md` (~5,090 tokens)
- All documents use `inclusion: manual` for conditional MCP loading

## Impact

- ✅ Canonical sources established for completion documentation and cross-references
- ✅ Architectural symmetry achieved (Rosetta + Stemma = complete design system foundation)
- ✅ MCP index healthy with all 58 documents indexed
- ✅ Foundation laid for Batch 2-3 content slimming (priming + MCP query directions)
