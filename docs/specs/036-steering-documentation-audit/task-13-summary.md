## What Changed

Slimmed File Organization Standards.md by moving detailed content to dedicated canonical sources and replacing with priming + MCP query directions.

## Key Outcomes

- **~4,930 tokens removed** from always-loaded File Organization Standards
- **Cross-reference guidance** now in Process-Cross-Reference-Standards.md (MCP-queryable)
- **Completion doc guidance** now in Completion Documentation Guide.md (MCP-queryable)
- **AI Agent Reading Priorities** updated with MCP query directions

## Impact

AI agents now receive streamlined File Organization Standards at session start, with detailed guidance available on-demand via MCP queries. This reduces context load while maintaining full access to comprehensive documentation.
