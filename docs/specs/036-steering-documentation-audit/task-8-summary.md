# Task 8 Summary: Implementation Planning Phase

**Date**: 2026-01-03
**Purpose**: Concise summary of Phase 3 implementation planning completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 036-steering-documentation-audit

## What Was Done

Completed Phase 3 (Implementation Planning) of the Steering Documentation Audit by creating four comprehensive planning artifacts:
- Detailed execution task list with 107 tasks across 18 batches
- Batch execution plan with phased approach and dependency management
- Git-based rollback strategy with MCP re-index procedures
- Validation criteria with success metrics for each batch

## Why It Matters

The implementation plan transforms approved audit recommendations into actionable execution tasks. The phased approach minimizes risk by processing lower-impact documents first, respecting dependencies, and enabling rollback at natural breakpoints.

## Key Changes

- Created execution-task-list.md: 107 tasks organized into 18 batches
- Created batch-execution-plan.md: 7-phase execution with parallel opportunities
- Created rollback-strategy.md: Git-based recovery with MCP re-indexing
- Created validation-criteria.md: Success criteria and MCP health checks

## Impact

- ✅ Clear execution roadmap for ~11,000 token savings
- ✅ Risk mitigation through phased approach
- ✅ Rollback capability at every batch boundary
- ✅ Validation criteria ensure quality at each step
