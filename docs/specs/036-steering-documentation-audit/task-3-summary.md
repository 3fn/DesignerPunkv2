# Task 3 Summary: Redundancy Analysis

**Date**: 2026-01-03
**Purpose**: Concise summary of redundancy analysis completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 036-steering-documentation-audit

## What Was Done

Completed comprehensive redundancy analysis of 55 steering documents, identifying 8 topics with cross-document overlap and classifying each as harmful redundancy or intentional priming.

## Why It Matters

Harmful redundancy creates maintenance burden and risks inconsistency. Identifying consolidation candidates enables targeted optimization that could save ~2,300 tokens while maintaining documentation quality.

## Key Changes

- Identified 5 harmful redundancy topics requiring consolidation
- Identified 3 intentional priming topics (acceptable, no action needed)
- Documented ~2,300 tokens of potential savings
- Flagged 3 human decisions required for Checkpoint 2

## Impact

- ✅ Clear classification of all redundant content
- ✅ Consolidation candidates prioritized by token savings
- ✅ Human decision points documented for Phase 2 Analysis
- ✅ Foundation laid for targeted optimization
