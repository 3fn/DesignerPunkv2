## What Was Done

Expanded Release Management System document with operational content for hook dependencies, troubleshooting, and manual triggers. Added navigation structure with AI Agent Reading Priorities and Document Structure sections.

## Why It Matters

AI agents now have release-specific operational guidance in the canonical release management document, reducing the need to cross-reference Development Workflow for common release-related tasks.

## Key Changes

- Added Agent Hook Dependency Chains section (~633 tokens)
- Added Hook Troubleshooting section (~1,026 tokens)
- Added Manual Trigger Commands section (~1,000 tokens)
- Added AI Agent Reading Priorities with task-based reading guidance
- Added Document Structure navigation table
- Total document: 5,452 tokens (from ~2,800 tokens)

## Requirements Addressed

- Requirement 3.3: Consolidated operational content into canonical source
- Requirement 3.7: Added MCP query directions for cross-document navigation
