**Spec**: 047 - Input-Radio-Base
**Task**: 9. Testing
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 047-input-radio-base

---

## What

Validated comprehensive test suite for Input-Radio-Base and Input-Radio-Set components across 5 test files covering unit tests, Stemma validators, and form integration.

## Why

Ensures both radio components meet all requirements for rendering, interaction, accessibility, orchestration pattern, and form compatibility before documentation phase.

## Impact

- All 306 test suites pass (7813 tests, 0 failures)
- Both components validated against Stemma System naming, token usage, and accessibility standards
- Form integration confirmed for name grouping, value submission, and reset behavior
- Orchestration pattern verified (Set uses slots, does not duplicate Base rendering)
