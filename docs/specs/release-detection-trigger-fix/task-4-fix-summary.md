# Task 4.FIX Summary: Document Hook Limitation and Hybrid Approach

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Spec**: release-detection-trigger-fix
**Type**: Implementation

---

## What Was Done

Updated three key documentation files (Spec Planning Standards, Development Workflow, and File Organization Standards) to document the hook limitation discovered during Task 4 completion: Kiro IDE's `fileCreated` and `fileSaved` hooks only trigger for manual file operations through the IDE UI, not for programmatically created files by AI agents.

## Why It Matters

This documentation update ensures developers understand when automatic hooks work (manual IDE operations) and when manual triggers are required (AI-assisted workflows). Without this clarity, developers might expect automatic release detection to work for AI-created files, leading to missed release triggers and incomplete workflows.

## Key Changes

- **Spec Planning Standards**: Added "Release detection triggered" to success criteria and post-completion step with manual trigger command
- **Development Workflow**: Updated workflow steps to include manual trigger for AI workflows and explained hybrid approach
- **File Organization Standards**: Added hook limitation section and updated rationale to reflect hybrid approach

## Impact

- ✅ Clear guidance for both manual and AI-assisted workflows
- ✅ Explicit success criterion prevents forgotten release detection
- ✅ Copy-pasteable manual trigger command reduces friction
- ✅ Consistent documentation across all three files
- ✅ Standard practice established for AI-assisted development
