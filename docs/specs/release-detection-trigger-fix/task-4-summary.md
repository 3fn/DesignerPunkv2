# Task 4 Summary: Update File Organization Standards Documentation

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Spec**: release-detection-trigger-fix
**Type**: Implementation

---

## What Was Done

Updated File Organization Standards with comprehensive documentation for the two-document workflow. Added summary document organization metadata (`spec-summary`), updated directory structure to show both `docs/specs/` and `.kiro/specs/` locations with visual indicators for hook triggering, and provided complete cross-reference guidance for linking between summary and detailed completion documents.

## Why It Matters

Enables developers to understand and correctly implement the two-document workflow for parent tasks. Clear documentation of where summary documents belong (`docs/specs/`) and why they're separate from detailed docs (`.kiro/` directory filtering) prevents common mistakes and ensures automatic release detection works reliably.

## Key Changes

- Added "Summary Documents" section defining `spec-summary` organization metadata with location `docs/specs/[spec-name]/`
- Updated "Spec-Specific Organization" section with two-directory structure showing visual indicators (✅/❌) for hook triggering behavior
- Added "Cross-References Between Summary and Detailed Docs" section with bidirectional linking patterns and working examples
- Included comparison table showing key distinctions between docs/specs/ (public, triggers hooks) and .kiro/specs/ (internal, no hooks)
- Documented file naming patterns for all document types (summary, detailed parent, subtask)

## Impact

- ✅ Complete guidance for two-document workflow in single location (File Organization Standards)
- ✅ Visual clarity through checkmarks and inline comments makes hook behavior immediately obvious
- ✅ Working examples with actual spec names provide concrete, immediately applicable guidance
- ✅ Bidirectional cross-reference patterns enable easy navigation between summary and detailed docs
- ✅ Prevents common mistake of creating summary documents in `.kiro/` directory where hooks don't trigger
