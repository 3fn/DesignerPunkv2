# Task 1 Summary: Update Spec Planning Standards with Summary Document Workflow

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Spec**: release-detection-trigger-fix
**Type**: Implementation

---

## What Was Done

Added "Parent Task Summary Documents" section to Spec Planning Standards documenting the new two-document workflow for parent task completion. This section explains the purpose, location, format, and rationale for creating concise summary documents that trigger release detection hooks. Updated task format examples to show both detailed and summary documentation paths, and added comprehensive cross-reference guidance.

## Why It Matters

Enables automatic release detection by creating summary documents in a location where Kiro IDE file watching can detect them (`.kiro/` directory is filtered). Provides clear guidance for future specs on creating both detailed internal documentation and concise public-facing summaries. This two-document approach maintains comprehensive knowledge preservation while enabling reliable hook triggering.

## Key Changes

- Added "Parent Task Summary Documents" section after "Documentation Best Practices" with complete format template
- Updated all parent task format examples to show both detailed and summary documentation paths
- Added cross-reference guidance with relative path calculations and best practices
- Explained rationale for two-document approach (`.kiro/` filtering + dual purpose as release notes)
- Included forward-looking note about applying to new specs only (no migration needed)

## Impact

- ✅ Clear documentation of summary document workflow for future specs
- ✅ Format template ensures consistent summary document structure across all specs
- ✅ Task format examples demonstrate the two-document pattern in practice
- ✅ Cross-reference guidance prevents broken links between summary and detailed docs
- ✅ Rationale explains why two documents are needed (hook triggering + release notes)
- ✅ Forward-looking approach avoids migration complexity for existing specs
