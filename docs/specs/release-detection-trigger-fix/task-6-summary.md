# Task 6 Summary: Clean Up Test Files and Old Configurations

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Spec**: release-detection-trigger-fix
**Type**: Setup

---

## What Was Done

Systematically cleaned up all test artifacts created during Task 5 validation testing and archived deprecated hook configurations with comprehensive documentation. Removed 3 test hook files, 2 test response files, 5 test markdown files, and archived 2 old `.json` hook configurations that used unsupported trigger types.

## Why It Matters

Maintains a clean, professional repository ready for normal development use. Preserves historical context by archiving deprecated configurations with documentation explaining the unsupported `taskStatusChange` trigger issue, providing valuable reference for future hook development.

## Key Changes

- Removed all test hook files from `.kiro/hooks/` directory
- Removed all test response files from root directory
- Removed all test markdown files from various locations
- Created `.kiro/hooks/archive/` directory with comprehensive README.md
- Archived deprecated hook configurations with failure analysis and lessons learned

## Impact

- ✅ Repository clean and ready for normal development workflow
- ✅ No test artifacts cluttering workspace
- ✅ Historical context preserved through archive documentation
- ✅ Production hooks remain intact and functional
- ✅ Clear documentation of hook system evolution for future reference
