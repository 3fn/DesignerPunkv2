**Type**: Implementation

---

## What Was Done

Updated Development Workflow documentation with comprehensive two-document workflow guidance, including updated task completion workflow (7 steps), manual release detection section, enhanced troubleshooting, and new Kiro IDE file watching behavior section explaining `.kiro/` directory filtering.

## Why It Matters

Provides developers with clear, actionable guidance for the new two-document workflow that enables reliable automatic release detection. Explains why two documents are needed (detailed for internal knowledge, summary for automation), where to create them, and how to troubleshoot when automation fails.

## Key Changes

- Updated Task Completion Workflow from 5 to 7 steps with detailed and summary document creation
- Added "Manual Release Detection" section with fallback trigger instructions
- Enhanced "Release Detection Not Triggering" troubleshooting with systematic checks
- Added "Kiro IDE File Watching Behavior" section explaining directory filtering
- Documented common mistake: creating summary in `.kiro/` directory instead of `docs/`

## Impact

- ✅ Clear workflow guidance for two-document approach prevents confusion
- ✅ Systematic troubleshooting enables self-service problem resolution
- ✅ File watching behavior explanation prevents common mistakes
- ✅ Manual fallback options ensure developers never get stuck
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation supports reliable automatic release detection
