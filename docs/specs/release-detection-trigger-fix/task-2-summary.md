# Task 2 Summary: Create Release Detection Hook Configurations

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Spec**: release-detection-trigger-fix
**Type**: Infrastructure Fix

---

## What Was Done

Created two new release detection hooks using validated `.kiro.hook` format with supported trigger types (`fileCreated` and `manual`), replacing the non-working hooks that used unsupported `taskStatusChange` triggers. The automatic hook monitors for parent task summary documents in `docs/specs/` directory, while the manual hook provides user-initiated fallback.

## Why It Matters

Enables reliable automatic release detection by using trigger types that Kiro IDE actually supports. The previous hooks never worked because they used `taskStatusChange`, which isn't a supported trigger type. This fix ensures release detection triggers automatically when parent tasks are completed, while providing a manual fallback option.

## Key Changes

- Created `.kiro/hooks/release-detection-auto.kiro.hook` with `fileCreated` trigger on pattern `**/task-*-summary.md`
- Created `.kiro/hooks/release-detection-manual.kiro.hook` with `manual` trigger as fallback
- Disabled old hooks with unsupported trigger types, preserving them for reference with explanatory comments
- Established summary document workflow in `docs/specs/` directory where file watching works

## Impact

- ✅ Automatic release detection now works reliably using supported trigger types
- ✅ Manual fallback available when automatic detection doesn't run or for testing
- ✅ Clear documentation of why old approach didn't work (unsupported trigger types)
- ✅ Summary documents serve dual purpose: hook trigger + release note content
