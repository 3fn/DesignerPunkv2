**Date**: December 7, 2025
**Spec**: 013-text-input-field
**Type**: Implementation

---

## What Was Done

Created comprehensive testing and documentation for the TextInputField component, including 11 unit test files, 1 integration test file with 37 tests, HTML canary examples demonstrating all component states, and complete README documentation with usage examples, API reference, and token consumption details.

## Why It Matters

Comprehensive testing ensures component quality and catches bugs early. Living documentation enables developers to understand, use, and maintain the component effectively. HTML examples provide visual validation that documentation stays accurate. Cross-platform tests verify consistency across web, iOS, and Android platforms.

## Key Changes

- Created 11 unit test files covering state management, label animation, icon visibility, accessibility, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, color contrast, and touch target sizing
- Created integration test suite with 37 tests validating Icon component integration, motion token integration, form integration, and cross-platform token usage
- Created TextInputStateExamples.html demonstrating all component states (default, focused, filled, error, success) with validation warning
- Created comprehensive README documentation with overview, usage examples, API reference, token consumption, accessibility features, and platform-specific notes
- Created cross-platform consistency tests verifying animation timing, easing curves, and token values across platforms

## Impact

- ✅ Complete test coverage ensures component quality and catches regressions
- ✅ Integration tests validate dependencies and token usage
- ✅ HTML examples provide visual validation and usage demonstrations
- ✅ README documentation enables developer understanding and adoption
- ✅ Cross-platform tests ensure consistent behavior across platforms
