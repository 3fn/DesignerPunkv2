# Task 5 Summary: Generate Analysis Report

**Date**: November 21, 2025
**Spec**: test-failure-analysis
**Type**: Implementation

---

## What Was Done

Generated comprehensive test failure analysis report consolidating all findings from the investigation. The report provides clear guidance for fixing all 65 test failures through a systematic, phased approach with evidence-based recommendations.

## Why It Matters

Provides complete foundation for creating an implementation spec to restore test suite confidence. The analysis identifies 6 distinct root causes with clear fix approaches, priorities, and effort estimates, enabling efficient restoration of all failing tests.

## Key Changes

- Created comprehensive analysis report with executive summary, root cause groups, and recommendations
- Consolidated all findings from previous tasks into clear, actionable format
- Provided phased fix order (quick wins → critical → high → medium) with dependencies noted
- Documented implementation spec structure guidance with requirements, design, and tasks recommendations
- Verified no code changes made (investigation only)

## Impact

- ✅ Complete analysis of 65 test failures across 11 test suites
- ✅ Clear prioritization: 51 critical (78%), 13 high (20%), 2 medium (3%)
- ✅ Realistic effort estimates: 14-25 hours total to fix all failures
- ✅ Evidence-based fix approaches with 85-95% confidence
- ✅ Implementation guidance ready for next phase
