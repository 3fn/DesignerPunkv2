# Task 4 Summary: Assess Priorities

**Date**: November 21, 2025
**Spec**: test-failure-analysis
**Type**: Implementation

---

## What Was Done

Completed comprehensive priority assessment for all 65 test failures across 6 root cause groups. Assigned priorities (Critical/High/Medium) based on impact, functionality at risk, and whether failures indicate actual bugs vs test issues. Estimated fix effort (14-25 hours total) and recommended 4-phase fix order starting with quick wins.

## Why It Matters

Priority assessment enables systematic, risk-managed approach to fixing test failures. Clear fix order maximizes impact while minimizing risk. Resource planning guidance (effort estimates) enables efficient allocation. Impact analysis justifies priorities and supports business decisions.

## Key Changes

- **priority-assessment.md**: Comprehensive priority assessment with 6 root cause groups
- **Priority Distribution**: Critical (2 groups, 51 tests), High (3 groups, 13 tests), Medium (1 group, 2 tests)
- **Fix Order**: 4-phase approach (Quick Wins → Critical → High Priority → Performance)
- **Effort Estimates**: 14-25 hours total with breakdown by priority level
- **Impact Analysis**: Actual bugs (31%) vs test issues (69%) with confidence levels

## Impact

- ✅ Clear fix order enables systematic approach to resolving all 65 failures
- ✅ Resource planning guidance (14-25 hours) enables efficient allocation
- ✅ Risk management through impact assessment and confidence levels
- ✅ Business alignment through documented rationale and impact analysis
- ✅ Quality assurance through confidence levels (80% high confidence)
