# Task 6 Summary: Create Token Quick Reference (D3)

**Date**: 2025-12-30
**Purpose**: Concise summary of parent task completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 033-steering-documentation-enhancements

## What Was Done

Created the Token Quick Reference steering document (`.kiro/steering/Token Quick Reference.md`) as a lightweight routing table for AI agents. The document uses `inclusion: always` to be available for every task while remaining small (~965 tokens).

## Why It Matters

AI agents now have a single entry point to discover and access all 14 token documentation files via MCP. This eliminates guesswork about which document to query and provides common UI patterns showing typical token combinations.

## Key Changes

- Created Token Documentation Map with 14 token types and their MCP paths
- Added 6 common UI patterns (Button, Card, Form Input, Modal, Interactive States, Responsive Layout)
- Included MCP query examples for progressive disclosure workflow
- Verified complete coverage after Tasks 3-5 filled documentation gaps

## Impact

- ✅ Complete token documentation routing (no gaps)
- ✅ Efficient token discovery for AI agents
- ✅ Sustainable context usage (~965 tokens for always-loaded doc)
- ✅ Progressive disclosure workflow documented
