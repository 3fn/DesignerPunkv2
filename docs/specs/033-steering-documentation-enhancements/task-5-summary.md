# Task 5 Summary: Create Responsive Token Documentation (D2.3)

**Date**: December 30, 2025
**Purpose**: Concise summary of parent task completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 033-steering-documentation-enhancements

## What Was Done

Created comprehensive responsive token steering documentation at `.kiro/steering/responsive-tokens.md` covering breakpoint and density token systems for responsive design across platforms.

## Why It Matters

AI agents now have complete guidance for implementing responsive interfaces using:
- Breakpoint tokens for viewport-based layout changes
- Density tokens for UI scaling (compact to spacious)
- Cross-platform patterns for web, iOS, and Android

## Key Changes

- Created `.kiro/steering/responsive-tokens.md` with `inclusion: manual`
- Documented 4 breakpoint tokens (xs: 320, sm: 375, md: 1024, lg: 1440)
- Documented 4 density tokens (compact: 0.75, default: 1.0, comfortable: 1.25, spacious: 1.5)
- Included selective scaling concept (functional vs aesthetic tokens)
- Added cross-platform usage examples and responsive design patterns

## Impact

- ✅ Completes D2.3 deliverable (Responsive Token Documentation)
- ✅ Fills responsive token gap identified in gap analysis
- ✅ Enables AI agents to implement accessible responsive interfaces
- ✅ Provides density scaling guidance for different interface contexts
