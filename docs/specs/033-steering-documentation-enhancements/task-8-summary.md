# Task 8 Summary: Update Meta-guide (D5)

**Date**: 2025-12-30
**Purpose**: Concise summary of parent task completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 033-steering-documentation-enhancements

## What Was Done

Updated the steering documentation meta-guide to include entries for the new Token Quick Reference and Release Management System documents.

## Why It Matters

AI agents can now discover these new steering documents through the meta-guide's progressive disclosure system, enabling efficient access to token documentation routing and release pipeline mental models.

## Key Changes

- Added Token Quick Reference entry to Tier 2 (MCP-Only Documents)
- Added Release Management System entry to Tier 2 (MCP-Only Documents)
- Both entries include MCP query examples and confirmation patterns
- All updates made via bash-only approach per implementation constraint

## Impact

- ✅ New steering documents are now discoverable via meta-guide
- ✅ AI agents can query token documentation routing table via MCP
- ✅ AI agents can access release pipeline mental model via MCP
- ✅ Context management improved by keeping both docs in Tier 2/manual
