# Task 2 Summary: Token Documentation Gap Analysis

**Date**: 2025-12-30
**Purpose**: Concise summary of parent task completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 033-steering-documentation-enhancements

## What Was Done

Performed comprehensive gap analysis comparing 38 token implementation files against 9 existing documentation files to identify documentation coverage and gaps.

## Why It Matters

The gap analysis informs the Token Quick Reference (D3) by identifying which token types have documentation (for routing) and which need "documentation pending" markers. It also provides a roadmap for future documentation work.

## Key Changes

- Audited 22 primitive token files in `src/tokens/`
- Audited 16 semantic token files in `src/tokens/semantic/`
- Mapped 9 existing documentation files to their token types
- Created comparison table showing 63% documentation coverage
- Identified 13 undocumented token types with priority recommendations

## Impact

- ✅ D3 (Token Quick Reference) can proceed with existing documentation
- ✅ 24 of 38 token types have documentation for routing
- ✅ 13 gaps identified with clear priority recommendations
- ✅ Follow-up Spec 034 recommended for documentation completion
