# Task 7 Summary: Create docs/tokens/ README (D4)

**Date**: 2025-12-30
**Purpose**: Concise summary of parent task completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 033-steering-documentation-enhancements

## What Was Done

Created signposting README at `docs/tokens/README.md` to guide developers who navigate to the directory, explaining that token documentation has moved to `.kiro/steering/` for MCP integration.

## Why It Matters

Developers navigating to `docs/tokens/` now find clear guidance instead of an empty or confusing directory. Both AI agents and human developers have explicit instructions for accessing token documentation through their preferred method.

## Key Changes

- Created `docs/tokens/README.md` with comprehensive signposting
- Added MCP query examples for AI agents (progressive disclosure workflow)
- Listed all 16 token documentation files for human developers
- Referenced Spec 032 as the source of the architectural decision

## Impact

- ✅ Clear navigation for developers finding `docs/tokens/`
- ✅ MCP access instructions enable efficient AI agent queries
- ✅ Human developers have direct file paths for all token docs
- ✅ Documentation architecture decision properly attributed
