**Date**: December 30, 2025
**Purpose**: Concise summary of parent task completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: 033-steering-documentation-enhancements

---

## What Was Done

Created comprehensive effect and interaction token documentation covering opacity tokens and accessibility-focused tokens (focus indicators, tap areas, icon sizing).

## Why It Matters

- Fills documentation gaps identified in Task 2 gap analysis
- Provides AI agents with clear guidance for opacity and accessibility token selection
- Ensures WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is explicitly documented with token mappings
- Completes the effect and interaction token documentation category

## Key Changes

- Created `.kiro/steering/opacity-tokens.md` with 14-token opacity scale and semantic mappings
- Created `.kiro/steering/accessibility-tokens.md` consolidating focus, tap area, and icon tokens
- Both documents include cross-platform implementation examples (Web, iOS, Android)
- Added AI agent token selection guidance for each token category

## Impact

- ✅ Effect and interaction tokens now fully documented
- ✅ WCAG success criteria explicitly mapped to accessibility tokens
- ✅ Token Quick Reference (Task 6) can now route to complete documentation
- ✅ AI agents have clear decision frameworks for opacity and accessibility tokens
