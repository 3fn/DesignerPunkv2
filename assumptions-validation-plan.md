## Assumption Validation Methodology

### Validation Approach Framework

**Evidence-Based Validation**: All assumptions must be validated through objective evidence rather than opinion or AI assessment

**Independent Verification**: Critical assumptions require validation methods independent of AI interpretation

**Measurable Outcomes**: Assumptions must be validated through measurable, observable outcomes

**Failure Mode Planning**: Each assumption includes explicit failure scenarios and detection methods

### Assumption Categories

**Architectural Assumptions**: Core beliefs about system architecture and design patterns
**Technical Assumptions**: Beliefs about implementation feasibility and performance
**Process Assumptions**: Beliefs about development methodologies and collaboration approaches
**Market Assumptions**: Beliefs about customer needs and competitive positioning

### Validation Priority Levels

**Critical**: Assumptions that, if wrong, would invalidate core strategic direction
**High**: Assumptions that significantly impact system design or resource allocation
**Medium**: Assumptions that affect individual systems without cascading effects
**Low**: Assumptions that can be validated through usage and iteration
