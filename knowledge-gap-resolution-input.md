## User Input on Critical Knowledge Gaps

### G1.1 Mathematical Token System Implementation - Process-First Approach

**User Decision**: Process-based validation over real-time tooling
**Rationale**: 
- Real-time validation tools require complex integration across multiple environments (Figma, VS Code, Xcode, Android Studio)
- Tool complexity includes platform-specific calculations, maintenance across tool updates, and user training overhead
- Process-based validation through task success criteria can achieve similar outcomes with less complexity and provide flexibility to address edge cases that automated tools might miss or incorrectly flag, allowing human judgment to handle false positives and false negatives
- "Good process before great tools" - prove the process works before building tools to automate it

**Coordination Framework Impact**:
- **System Development Approach**: Design all systems to include validation checks in their success criteria rather than depending on real-time tooling
- **Validation Strategy**: Clear semantic token usage guidelines for AI agents, validation checklists integrated into development workflows, peer review processes
- **Tool Development Priority**: Include tool development as optional/later-phase rather than foundational
- **Process Optimization**: Focus coordination on making the process so clear that tools become less necessary

**Gap Resolution Timing**: Parallel development with process-based validation
- Systems can develop with clear semantic token usage guidelines
- Validation happens through task success criteria and peer review
- Tool development only if specific process failures are identified

### G2.1 Cross-Platform Mathematical Consistency - Preliminary Guidelines with Refinement

**User Decision**: Preliminary guidelines with parallel development and mid-development refinement
**Rationale**:
- Perfect mathematical consistency is impractical and rarely possible
- Strategic flexibility tokens (6px, 10px, 20px) exist specifically to handle consistency challenges
- Platform-specific rounding rules and guidelines can be established preliminarily and refined during development
- Parallel development more efficient than waiting for perfect guidelines

**Coordination Framework Impact**:
- **Development Sequencing**: Systems can develop in parallel while cross-platform guidelines are refined
- **Guidelines Approach**: Start with preliminary cross-platform rounding guidelines that can be updated as systems develop
- **Platform-Specific Rules**: Handle rounding behaviors on a platform-by-platform basis at token and component levels
- **Refinement Process**: Track and update guidelines mid-development with awareness of potential challenges

**Gap Resolution Timing**: Parallel development with preliminary guidelines
- Establish initial cross-platform rounding and consistency guidelines
- Allow component development and other systems to proceed with preliminary guidelines
- Refine guidelines based on real-world development experience

### G3.1 AI Collaboration Scope - Skepticism Default with Progressive Relaxation

**User Decision**: Default to skepticism during pre and early-development phase with progressive relaxation as foundations solidify
**Rationale**:
- Early development phase requires more cautious approach due to architectural uncertainty
- Skepticism can be progressively alleviated as architectural decisions and foundations become firmer
- AI agents should proactively ask questions for clarification when uncertain
- Conflict detection challenges exist, especially when guidance uses different terminology for same concepts

**Coordination Framework Impact**:
- **Conflict Detection Protocol**: When AI detects potential conflicts during coordination tasks, default to flagging for human review (skepticism approach)
- **Progressive Relaxation**: As architectural foundations solidify, coordination can shift toward standard collaboration for established patterns
- **Proactive Clarification**: AI agents should ask questions when uncertain rather than making assumptions
- **Terminology Awareness**: Special attention to conflicts where guidance uses different terminology for same concepts

**Gap Resolution Timing**: Immediate implementation with evolution over time
- Start with skepticism default for all borderline architectural decisions
- Progressively relax skepticism as confidence in foundations builds
- Maintain proactive clarification approach throughout development
- The practice of relaxation can only begin with explicit consent of a human after agreeing to what that relaxed position would entail

## Process-First Validation Strategy

### Validation Through Task Success Criteria

**Implementation Approach**:
- **Clear Semantic Token Usage Guidelines**: Explicit direction for AI agents on using semantic tokens (space075, space100, radius100, size275) in most situations
- **Task Completion Validation**: Validation checks as part of success criteria before marking tasks complete
- **Peer Review Integration**: Human review processes that catch token misuse and architectural deviations
- **Documentation Clarity**: Make correct usage obvious through clear documentation and examples in alignment with the documentation validation framework

**Coordination Integration**:
- All systems include validation processes in their development workflows
- Success criteria explicitly include validation requirements
- Process effectiveness measured and refined based on real-world usage
- Tool development considered only after process limitations are identified

### Tool Development as Process Enhancement

**Progressive Tool Development**:
- **Process Exposure**: Process should expose opportunities for better tools before jumping into tooling
- **Repetition Identification**: If repetitive, cumbersome tasks are encountered, leverage tools such as (but not limited to) steering and hooks to offload repetitions
- **Pre/Post Task Evaluation**: Include evaluation of whether tooling would be more optimal solution as part of task process
- **Needs Understanding**: Avoid tooling until firm understanding of needs is established

**Tool Integration Strategy**:
- Tools enhance proven processes and needs rather than replace unproven ones
- Automation focuses on repetitive validation tasks that have been proven effective manually
- Tool complexity justified by clear process limitations and efficiency gains
- Maintain process-based fallbacks for tool failures or limitations. Example: If a tool is designed to validate five specific use case and an unknown use case exists, processes should expose that use case that the tool should be updated to support.

## Preliminary Cross-Platform Guidelines

### Platform-Specific Rounding Behaviors

**Initial Guidelines** (to be refined during development):
- **Web**: Standard CSS pixel rounding with subpixel rendering support
- **iOS**: Point-based calculations with @2x/@3x density scaling
- **Android**: Density-independent pixel (dp) calculations with density scaling

**Refinement Process**:
- Test mathematical relationships on actual devices during component development
- Document platform-specific rendering differences and their impact on visual consistency
- Update guidelines based on real-world visual consistency validation
- Maintain strategic flexibility tokens as escape valves for consistency challenges

### Mathematical Consistency Validation

**Validation Approach**:
- Visual consistency validation on representative devices rather than theoretical calculations
- Cross-platform rendering comparison during component development
- Mathematical relationship preservation through semantic token usage patterns
- Strategic flexibility token usage for cases where perfect consistency isn't achievable

**Success Criteria**:
- Mathematical relationships produce equivalent visual results across platforms within acceptable tolerance
- Strategic flexibility tokens used appropriately for genuine consistency challenges
- Platform-specific optimizations don't break overall mathematical consistency
- Cross-platform rendering differences documented and intentional vs accidental. Example: When creating a layout grid, margins and gutters require explict values for all platforms. When defining columns of the layout grid, percentages (which produce fractional values) can be leveraged on web; but whole number values must be defined for the iOS platform.

## AI Collaboration Conflict Resolution

### Skepticism Default Protocol

**Conflict Detection Approach**:
- **Terminology Conflicts**: Special attention to guidance using different terminology for same concepts
- **Context Conflicts**: Flag conflicts that require deep context understanding for human review
- **Document Coverage**: Acknowledge limitations when relevant documents haven't been accessed
- **Proactive Clarification**: Ask questions when uncertain rather than making assumptions

**Progressive Relaxation Criteria**:
- **Foundation Confidence**: As architectural decisions become proven through implementation
- **Pattern Establishment**: When coordination patterns are validated through repeated successful application
- **Risk Assessment**: Lower-risk decisions can shift to standard collaboration sooner
- **Feedback Integration**: User feedback on skepticism effectiveness guides relaxation timing
- **Explicit Consent Required**: The practice of relaxation can only begin with explicit consent of a human after agreeing to what that relaxed position would entail. Example: In a scope of work, there might be 10 tasks with naming convention update requirements. If a clear pattern is established and clearly defined after three of those tasks are completed, the AI Agent might prompt the user to if the agent needs to be skeptical of the remaining seven updates.

### Coordination Decision Framework

**Skepticism Required**:
- System boundary definitions and changes
- Cross-platform consistency requirements and validation approaches
- Mathematical foundation modifications and extensions
- Integration pattern establishment and evolution
- Naming convention decisions and standards
- Any decision with potential cascading impact across multiple systems

**Standard Collaboration Acceptable**:
- Implementation decisions within established architectural boundaries
- Component development following established patterns
- Template creation using validated architectural approaches
- Performance optimization within established frameworks
- Decisions with limited scope and clear rollback capability

**Borderline Case Protocol**:
- Default to skepticism during pre and early-development phase
- Ask proactive clarification questions when uncertain
- Document decision rationale for future reference
- Include user feedback mechanism for skepticism effectiveness
- IF an AI Agent receives a request whose output might contradicts with a previously understood direction, THEN the AI Agent should prompt the user for clarification citing the contradiction and its source

**AI Agent Self-Assessment and Escalation Framework**:

**Contamination Vector Recognition** - Escalate immediately when:
- Two or more syntax errors occur in the same file and/or across files
- Making decisions based on flawed or unvalidated data
- Creating class names without considering naming conventions, source, references, and/or destination context
- Repeating patterns that have previously caused issues

**Over-Engineering Detection** - Stop and reassess when:
- The effort of creating a tool or validation process exceeds the effort of resolving the issue directly
- Adding complexity that doesn't directly serve the stated requirements
- Creating abstractions without clear, immediate benefit

**Process Failure Recognition** - Escalate after:
- Two unsuccessful attempts using the same approach
- When the outcome of the process does not produce the expected result
- When the current approach is clearly not working and alternative means are needed

**Uncertainty Indicators** - Use instead of confidence percentages:
"I'm uncertain about this approach because:
- I haven't seen similar examples in the documentation
- This conflicts with guidance from [specific source]
- This requires knowledge about [specific domain] that I may not have
- This involves [specific technical area] where I've made errors before

Should I proceed with this approach, or would you prefer I ask specific questions about these uncertain areas?"

**Human Consent Required When**:
- Suggesting architectural changes beyond the explicit task scope
- Interpreting ambiguous requirements that could have multiple valid interpretations
- Choosing between multiple valid approaches without clear guidance
- When a solution drifts beyond the scope of the explicit task
- Making decisions that could have cascading impact across multiple systems
