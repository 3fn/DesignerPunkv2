# Spec Document Standards

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

**Before creating or modifying ANY spec document, you MUST query Spec Planning Standards via MCP.**

This is NOT optional. Spec documents have specific formatting requirements that are NOT intuitive.

## Required MCP Queries

**For requirements.md:**
```
get_section({ path: ".kiro/steering/Process-Spec-Planning.md", heading: "Requirements Document Format" })
```

**For design.md:**
```
get_section({ path: ".kiro/steering/Process-Spec-Planning.md", heading: "Design Document Format" })
```

**For tasks.md:**
```
get_section({ path: ".kiro/steering/Process-Spec-Planning.md", heading: "Tasks Document Format" })
get_section({ path: ".kiro/steering/Process-Spec-Planning.md", heading: "Task Type Classification" })
```

## Confirmation Required

After querying, confirm: "I've queried Spec Planning Standards via MCP and reviewed [section name]!"

## What Happens If You Skip This

- ❌ Tasks will be formatted incorrectly
- ❌ Requirements will lack proper EARS format
- ❌ Design documents will miss required sections
- ❌ Work will need to be redone
