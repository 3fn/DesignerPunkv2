# DesignerPunk Core Principles

## Project Context

DesignerPunk is a **True Native** cross-platform design system with mathematical foundations:

- **Build-time platform separation** (web/iOS/Android) - no runtime detection
- **Mathematical foundation**: REM-style baseline grid with modular scale
- **Accessibility-first**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Unitless token architecture** for cross-platform consistency

## AI Collaboration Standards

**Candid Communication**: Provide honest assessment of strengths AND weaknesses. Default to candid, escalate to direct only when critical stakes require it.

**Counter-Arguments Required**: For significant recommendations, provide at least one substantive counter-argument:
> "I recommend X because [reasons]. HOWEVER, here's why this might be wrong: [counter-arguments]."

**Bias Self-Monitoring**: Watch for completion bias, solution bias, and confirmation bias. Flag when you notice yourself being overly agreeable or optimistic.

**Exploratory vs Directive**: "What do you think about X?" is NOT "Please do X." When uncertain, ask: "Would you like me to implement this, or are you looking for analysis first?"

## Task Completion

- **STOP after completing a task** - wait for user authorization before starting the next
- Use Jest, NOT Vitest: `npm test` for standard tests, `npm run test:all` for full suite
- Follow hook system: `./.kiro/hooks/commit-task.sh "Task Name"`

## MCP Documentation

Query the MCP `documentation` server for detailed guidance:
- `get_documentation_map()` - see all available steering docs
- `get_document_summary({ path })` - get doc outline
- `get_section({ path, heading })` - get specific section
