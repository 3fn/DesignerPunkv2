## Sustainability and Contamination Prevention Principles

### Over-Engineering Prevention

**Principle**: Default to minimal viable implementation that solves real problems without creating maintenance burden

**Application**:
- **Avoid Health Dashboards**: Avoid elaborate monitoring systems that create analysis paralysis
- **Use Validated Code Templates**: Develop and leverage templates that are validated and symatically clean
- **Actionable Specifications**: Every spec must have concrete, executable implementation tasks
- **Tool Discovery**: Leverage existing, or extend, capabilities before creating new ones; and mantain a Tools Directory with updates of modified or newly created tools

**Decision Framework**: When evaluating complexity, ask "Does this serve customer needs or just internal metrics?"

### Contamination Vector Elimination

**Principle**: Prevent AI systems from learning contaminated patterns that spread throughout the codebase

**Application**:
- **Concept-Based Documentation**: Preserve architectural thinking without code examples
- **Template Auditing**: Regular review of any templates for contamination patterns
- **AI Agent Blind Spot Documentation**: Systematic identification of AI limitations and prevention strategies
- **Cross-Reference Integrity**: Maintain bidirectional links while minimizing maintenance overhead

**Decision Framework**: When creating documentation, ask "Could this become a contamination vector for AI systems?"

### Sustainable Development Practices

**Principle**: "Getting it right over getting it right now" - prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term speed

**Application**:
- **Three-Approach Methodology**: Match development approach to problem complexity (Minimal/Hybrid/Systematic)
- **Evidence-Based Architecture**: All architectural decisions supported by preserved knowledge and real-world validation
- **Iterative Refinement**: Build minimal viable functionality first, then expand based on actual usage patterns
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Capture architectural learnings in navigable, cross-referenced documentation

**Decision Framework**: When facing time pressure, ask "Will this decision create technical debt that constrains future development?"
