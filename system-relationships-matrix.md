## System Relationship Mapping Methodology

### Current Strategic Direction Integration

Based on strategic direction evolution, system relationships reflect:

**Token System Integrated Generation**: Token system with integrated Translation Providers generates platform-specific units, components consume pre-generated platform constants, build system selects and packages appropriate platform outputs

**Mathematical Validation Refinement**: Strategic flexibility tokens (6px, 10px, 20px) treated as Pass-level validation, component-stage validation with team context, AI agents require explicit approval for new flexibility tokens

**AI Collaboration Scope**: Architectural decisions (system boundaries, cross-platform patterns, mathematical foundation, integration patterns, naming conventions) require skepticism protocols

**Two-Layer Cross-Platform Consistency**: API/functional consistency required, platform-native implementation differences encouraged when appropriate

### Relationship Classification Framework

**Hard Dependencies**: System B cannot function without System A (sequential development required)
**Soft Dependencies**: System B significantly enhanced by System A (parallel development possible)
**Coordination Points**: Systems must coordinate but don't depend on each other (integration planning required)
**Independent Systems**: Can develop and operate without other system dependencies

## System Coordination Framework Principles

### Two-Layer Cross-Platform Consistency Principle

**API/Functional Consistency** (Required across all platforms):
- Component interfaces (props, methods, events) must be identical
- Mathematical relationships (sizing, spacing, typography) must be preserved
- Accessibility behavior (screen reader support, keyboard navigation) must be consistent
- Core functionality (what the component does) must be identical

**Platform-Native Implementation** (Encouraged differences when appropriate):
- Visual feedback patterns (Android ripple vs iOS highlight) should follow platform conventions
- Animation timing/easing should align with platform-specific guidelines
- Touch/interaction patterns should use platform-appropriate gestures
- Platform-specific optimizations should be implemented when beneficial

**Documentation Requirement**: Component architecture must document when platform differences are intentional vs accidental to prevent consistency validation false positives.

### Strategic Flexibility Token Control Principle

**AI Agent Restrictions**:
- AI agents cannot create new strategic flexibility tokens without explicit human approval
- System must flag any attempt to create tokens outside approved set (6px, 10px, 20px)
- Clear escalation path required for AI requests for new flexibility patterns

**Validation Integration**:
- Strategic flexibility tokens validate as Pass without generating warnings
- Other off-baseline values continue to generate warnings for human review
- Component-stage validation provides context for teams to make informed decisions

### Architectural Decision Skepticism Principle

**Skepticism Required For**:
- System boundary definitions and changes
- Cross-platform consistency requirements and validation approaches
- Mathematical foundation modifications and extensions
- Integration pattern establishment and evolution
- Naming convention decisions and standards

**Standard Collaboration For**:
- Implementation decisions within established architectural boundaries
- Component development following established patterns
- Template creation using validated architectural approaches
- Performance optimization within established frameworks

### Build-Time Optimization Principle

**Semantic Token Generation**: Platform-specific semantic token constants (space075, space100, radius100, size275) generated before component development for real-time developer feedback
**Component Development**: Platform-specific implementations (Swift/Kotlin/Web) developed with direct semantic token constant access, composing tokens rather than using component-specific values
**Build System Role**: Packaging and optimization layer rather than coordination bottleneck
**Performance Validation**: Build system provides platform-specific builds for performance measurement and optimization

## Knowledge Gap Integration into Coordination Framework

### Process-First Coordination Principles

Based on user input on knowledge gap resolution, the coordination framework integrates the following principles:

**Process-Based Validation Strategy**:
- All system integration points use process-based validation rather than dependence on specialized tooling
- Success criteria for all systems explicitly include validation requirements for semantic token usage, cross-platform consistency, and architectural alignment
- Tool development considered only after process limitations are clearly identified through real-world usage

**Parallel Development with Preliminary Guidelines**:
- Systems can develop in parallel with preliminary guidelines that are refined during implementation
- Knowledge gaps don't block system development but are resolved through real-world implementation experience
- Cross-platform consistency achieved through preliminary rounding guidelines refined during component development

**Skepticism Default with Progressive Relaxation**:
- Architectural decisions during coordination planning default to skepticism protocols (counter-arguments, bias mitigation)
- Implementation decisions within established architectural boundaries use standard collaboration
- Skepticism progressively relaxed as architectural foundations are proven through implementation
