## How to Use This Log

When we face a decision with multiple viable approaches and choose one path, the unchosen alternatives can be documented here. This isn't about proving anyone right or wrong — it's about preserving options we might want to revisit if circumstances change or if we hit unexpected obstacles.

**When to Log:**
- When multiple viable approaches existed
- When the decision involved meaningful trade-offs
- When the alternative might become relevant if circumstances change
- NOT for "I think you're making a mistake" moments
- NOT for minor stylistic or implementation preferences
