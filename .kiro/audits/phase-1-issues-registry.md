### Well-Formatted Issue Examples

#### Example 1: Critical Infrastructure Issue

```markdown
## Issue #001: Release Detection Hook Not Triggering on Task Completion

**Discovered By**: Infrastructure Discovery Audit
**Date Discovered**: 2025-10-28
**Severity**: Critical
**Category**: Release Management
**Affects**: Release management system, task completion workflow, automated release analysis

**Location**:
- **File(s)**: `.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh` (lines 45-52), `.kiro/agent-hooks/release-detection-on-task-completion.json`
- **System**: Release Management System
- **Context**: Task completion event handling in agent hooks

**Description**:
The release detection hook is configured to trigger automatically when tasks are marked complete via the taskStatus tool, but the hook is not executing. This prevents automatic release analysis from running after spec completion, requiring manual intervention to trigger release detection.

The issue appears to be that taskStatus events are not being received by the agent hook system, or the hook configuration is not properly registered. This breaks the automated release detection workflow that was designed to run after task completions.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Open `.kiro/specs/phase-1-discovery-audit/tasks.md`
2. Mark task 1.1 as complete using taskStatus tool: `taskStatus("1.1 Create centralized issues registry", "completed")`
3. Check `.kiro/logs/release-manager.log` for execution log entry
4. Observe: No log entry created, indicating hook did not execute
5. Check `.kiro/release-triggers/` directory for trigger files
6. Observe: No trigger files created

**Expected Behavior**:
When a task is marked complete using the taskStatus tool, the release detection hook should automatically execute, check for release triggers, and create trigger files if spec completion is detected.

**Actual Behavior**:
The release detection hook does not execute when tasks are marked complete. No log entries are created in `.kiro/logs/release-manager.log` and no trigger files are created in `.kiro/release-triggers/`.

**Evidence**:
```bash
# .kiro/logs/release-manager.log - No entries after task completion
# Expected to see:
# [2025-10-28 10:30:00] Task completion detected: 1.1 Create centralized issues registry
# [2025-10-28 10:30:01] Checking for release triggers...

# Actual: File is empty or has no recent entries
```

```json
// .kiro/agent-hooks/release-detection-on-task-completion.json
{
  "name": "Release Detection on Task Completion",
  "trigger": {
    "type": "taskStatusChange",
    "status": "completed"
  },
  "settings": {
    "requireConfirmation": false,
    "autoApprove": true,
    "runAfter": ["organize-after-task-completion"]
  }
}
```

**Workaround**:
Manually trigger release detection after task completion:
```bash
./.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto
```

**Cross-Area Impact**:
- Infrastructure: Critical - Breaks automated release detection workflow
- Architecture: None - Does not affect code architecture
- Token System: None - Does not affect token generation
- Documentation: Minor - Release analysis documentation may be incomplete

**Related Issues**:
- `.kiro/issues/release-manager-taskstatus-trigger-issue.md` - Known issue documenting this problem

#### Example 2: Important Architecture Issue

```markdown
## Issue #002: Platform Generator Interface Inconsistency

**Discovered By**: Architecture Discovery Audit
**Date Discovered**: 2025-10-28
**Severity**: Important
**Category**: Platform Consistency
**Affects**: Cross-platform build system, platform generators (Web, iOS, Android)

**Location**:
- **File(s)**: `src/providers/WebFormatGenerator.ts`, `src/providers/iOSFormatGenerator.ts`, `src/providers/AndroidFormatGenerator.ts`
- **System**: Platform Generation System
- **Context**: Platform-specific format generator implementations

**Description**:
The three platform generators (Web, iOS, Android) implement similar functionality but use inconsistent method names and signatures. WebFormatGenerator uses `generateCSS()`, iOSFormatGenerator uses `generateSwift()`, and AndroidFormatGenerator uses `generateKotlin()`, but they all serve the same purpose of generating platform-specific token files.

This inconsistency makes it difficult to work with generators polymorphically and violates the principle of consistent interfaces across platform implementations.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Open `src/providers/WebFormatGenerator.ts` and note the `generateCSS()` method
2. Open `src/providers/iOSFormatGenerator.ts` and note the `generateSwift()` method
3. Open `src/providers/AndroidFormatGenerator.ts` and note the `generateKotlin()` method
4. Observe: Different method names for the same conceptual operation

**Expected Behavior**:
All platform generators should implement a common interface with consistent method names, such as `generate()` or `generateTokenFile()`, allowing them to be used polymorphically.

**Actual Behavior**:
Each platform generator uses a platform-specific method name, requiring conditional logic or type checking to work with different generators.

**Evidence**:
```typescript
// src/providers/WebFormatGenerator.ts
export class WebFormatGenerator {
  generateCSS(tokens: Token[]): string {
    // Web-specific generation
  }
}

// src/providers/iOSFormatGenerator.ts
export class iOSFormatGenerator {
  generateSwift(tokens: Token[]): string {
    // iOS-specific generation
  }
}

// src/providers/AndroidFormatGenerator.ts
export class AndroidFormatGenerator {
  generateKotlin(tokens: Token[]): string {
    // Android-specific generation
  }
}
```

**Workaround**:
Use conditional logic based on platform type:
```typescript
if (platform === 'web') {
  output = webGenerator.generateCSS(tokens);
} else if (platform === 'ios') {
  output = iosGenerator.generateSwift(tokens);
} else if (platform === 'android') {
  output = androidGenerator.generateKotlin(tokens);
}
```

**Cross-Area Impact**:
- Infrastructure: Minor - Build orchestration requires platform-specific logic
- Architecture: Important - Violates interface consistency principle
- Token System: None - Does not affect token definitions
- Documentation: Minor - Documentation must explain platform-specific methods

**Related Issues**:
None - New issue discovered during architecture audit

#### Example 3: Minor Documentation Issue

```markdown
## Issue #003: Outdated Token Examples in Typography Guide

**Discovered By**: Documentation Discovery Audit
**Date Discovered**: 2025-10-28
**Severity**: Minor
**Category**: Documentation Accuracy
**Affects**: Typography token documentation

**Location**:
- **File(s)**: `docs/tokens/typography-tokens.md` (lines 45-67)
- **System**: Documentation
- **Context**: Typography token usage examples

**Description**:
The typography token guide includes code examples that reference old token names (`typography.bodyText` and `typography.headingText`) that were renamed to `typography.body` and `typography.heading` in the typography token expansion spec. The examples still work conceptually but use outdated naming.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Open `docs/tokens/typography-tokens.md`
2. Scroll to "Usage Examples" section (around line 45)
3. Observe: Examples use `typography.bodyText` and `typography.headingText`
4. Open `src/tokens/semantic/TypographyTokens.ts`
5. Observe: Actual tokens are named `typography.body` and `typography.heading`

**Expected Behavior**:
Documentation examples should use current token names that match the actual implementation.

**Actual Behavior**:
Documentation examples use old token names from before the typography token expansion.

**Evidence**:
```markdown
<!-- docs/tokens/typography-tokens.md (lines 45-50) -->
## Usage Examples

```typescript
// Apply body text styling
const bodyStyle = tokens.typography.bodyText;

// Apply heading styling
const headingStyle = tokens.typography.headingText;
```
```

```typescript
// src/tokens/semantic/TypographyTokens.ts (actual implementation)
export const TypographyTokens = {
  body: { fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 24, ... },
  heading: { fontSize: 24, lineHeight: 32, ... }
};
```

**Workaround**:
Developers can infer the correct token names from the implementation file or other documentation.

**Cross-Area Impact**:
- Infrastructure: None
- Architecture: None
- Token System: None
- Documentation: Minor - May cause brief confusion for developers

**Related Issues**:
None - Isolated documentation issue

## Issue #001: Release Detection Hook Not Triggering on taskStatus Events

**Discovered By**: Infrastructure Discovery Audit
**Date Discovered**: 2025-10-28
**Severity**: Critical
**Category**: Release Management
**Affects**: Release management system, task completion workflow, automated release analysis, version management

**Location**:
- **File(s)**: `.kiro/agent-hooks/release-detection-on-task-completion.json`, `.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh`
- **System**: Release Management System - Agent Hook Integration
- **Context**: Task completion event handling in Kiro IDE agent hooks

**Description**:
The release detection agent hook is configured to trigger automatically when tasks are marked complete via the taskStatus tool, but the hook is not executing. This prevents automatic release analysis from running after spec completion, requiring manual intervention to trigger release detection.

The agent hook configuration specifies `"type": "taskStatusChange"` with `"status": "completed"` as the trigger, and is set to run after the file organization hook. However, when tasks are marked complete using the taskStatus tool, no log entries appear in `.kiro/logs/release-manager.log` and no release trigger files are created in `.kiro/release-triggers/`.

This breaks the entire automated release detection workflow. The system was designed to automatically detect spec completions, analyze completion documents, calculate version bumps, and generate release notes. Without the hook triggering, all of this automation is non-functional.

The issue was discovered when completing the Layering Token System spec (Task 7) with 20 completion documents. Despite using the taskStatus tool as recommended, the release analyzer found "0 completion documents" and reported no version bump.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Open `.kiro/specs/layering-token-system/tasks.md`
2. Mark task 7 as complete using taskStatus tool
3. Verify 20 completion documents exist: `find .kiro/specs/layering-token-system/completion -name "*completion.md" | wc -l`
4. Check release manager log: `tail -20 .kiro/logs/release-manager.log`
5. Observe: No log entry for layering-token-system completion (last entry is from afternoon-to-dusk-rename on Oct 28 18:03:55)
6. Check for release trigger files: `ls -la .kiro/release-triggers/ | grep layering`
7. Observe: No trigger files created for layering-token-system
8. Run release analysis: `npm run release:analyze`
9. Observe: "Found 0 completion documents" despite 20 documents existing

**Expected Behavior**:
When a task is marked complete using the taskStatus tool:
1. Kiro IDE emits a `taskStatusChange` event with status "completed"
2. Release detection agent hook receives the event
3. Hook executes `.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto`
4. Release manager scans for completion documents in the spec directory
5. Release manager creates trigger files in `.kiro/release-triggers/`
6. Release manager logs activity to `.kiro/logs/release-manager.log`
7. Release analyzer processes trigger files and analyzes completion documents
8. Version bump is calculated and release notes are generated

**Actual Behavior**:
When a task is marked complete using the taskStatus tool:
1. Task status updates in tasks.md (this works)
2. File organization hook may execute (separate issue)
3. Release detection hook does NOT execute
4. No log entries created in release manager log
5. No trigger files created
6. Release analyzer finds 0 completion documents
7. No version bump calculated
8. No release notes generated

**Evidence**:
```bash
# Completion documents exist
$ find .kiro/specs/layering-token-system/completion -name "*completion.md" | wc -l
20

# But release manager log shows no detection
$ tail -20 .kiro/logs/release-manager.log | grep layering
# (no results - last entry is afternoon-to-dusk-rename from Oct 28 18:03:55)

# No trigger files created
$ ls -la .kiro/release-triggers/ | grep layering
# (no results)

# Release analyzer finds nothing
$ npm run release:analyze

```json
// .kiro/release-config.json
// Release detection is enabled
{
  "detection": {

    "monitorPaths": [
      ".kiro/specs/*/completion/",
      ".kiro/specs/*/tasks.md"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Workaround**:
Manually trigger release detection after task completion:
```bash
./.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto
```

This workaround defeats the purpose of automation and requires developers to remember to run the command after every task completion.

**Cross-Area Impact**:
- Infrastructure: Critical - Breaks automated release detection workflow, requires manual intervention
- Architecture: None - Does not affect code architecture or patterns
- Token System: None - Does not affect token generation or validation
- Documentation: Important - Release analysis documentation may be incomplete without automated detection
