## Overview

This document defines the format and structure for creating feature specifications in the DesignerPunk project. Specs follow a three-phase workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks, with each phase building on the previous to create comprehensive, actionable implementation plans.

**When to use this document**: When creating new specs or updating existing spec documents (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md).

**How to use this document**: See "AI Agent Reading Priorities" above - read only the sections relevant to your current task.

## Task Type Classification System

### Overview

The Task Type Classification System provides a three-tier approach to categorizing tasks based on their complexity, risk, and nature of work. Task types are determined during the planning phase (when creating tasks.md) and guide the appropriate level of validation and completion documentation during execution.

This classification system enables:
- **Objective task categorization** based on clear characteristics
- **Appropriate validation depth** matched to task complexity and risk
- **Proportional documentation detail** aligned with task type
- **Consistent AI agent execution** through unambiguous task metadata

### Three Task Types

#### Setup Tasks

**Definition**: Structural work that prepares the environment for implementation

**Characteristics**:
- Creates directories, files, or configuration without complex logic
- Low complexity with straightforward operations
- Minimal logic or decision-making required
- Low risk with easily detected and fixed errors
- Clear success criteria based on artifact presence

**Examples**:
- Create directory structure for new feature
- Install project dependencies via package manager
- Configure build scripts in package.json
- Set up test framework with basic configuration
- Create placeholder files with basic exports
- Initialize configuration files (tsconfig.json, .eslintrc)

**Validation & Documentation**: Tier 1 - Minimal

#### Implementation Tasks

**Definition**: Coding work that implements features or functionality

**Characteristics**:
- Writes code to implement specific functionality or features
- Medium complexity requiring understanding of requirements and integration
- Functional validation needed to ensure correctness
- Integration focus connecting with existing code and components
- Medium risk with errors typically contained to specific features
- Testable outcomes measured by functional correctness

**Examples**:
- Implement class methods with business logic
- Create API endpoints with request validation
- Build UI components with event handlers
- Write integration logic coordinating multiple components
- Implement data transformations and conversions
- Create validation functions with error handling
- Build file generation logic for specific platforms

**Validation & Documentation**: Tier 2 - Standard

#### Architecture Tasks

**Definition**: Design work that establishes patterns, algorithms, or system structure

**Characteristics**:
- Makes architectural decisions affecting system structure and patterns
- High complexity requiring deep understanding of system requirements
- Design validation needed for extensibility and maintainability
- Pattern establishment creating abstractions other code will follow
- High risk with decisions affecting entire system
- Strategic impact influencing development approach and evolution

**Examples**:
- Design orchestration architecture with separation of concerns
- Create validation algorithms with extensibility points
- Establish error handling strategy and recovery patterns
- Design plugin system with clear extension points
- Create mathematical token system with hierarchical relationships
- Design caching strategy with multi-level architecture
- Establish state management architecture and patterns

**Validation & Documentation**: Tier 3 - Comprehensive

#### Parent Tasks

**Definition**: Container tasks that encompass multiple subtasks and define overall success criteria

**Characteristics**:
- Defines WHAT success looks like for a group of related subtasks
- Includes explicit success criteria that span all subtasks
- Requires verification that all subtasks integrate correctly
- Validates end-to-end functionality across subtask boundaries
- Documents overall approach and integration story

**Validation & Documentation**: Tier 3 - Comprehensive (with success criteria verification)

### Classification During Planning Phase

#### When to Classify

Task types are determined during **Phase 3: Tasks** of the spec workflow, when converting the design document into actionable implementation tasks.

#### Classification Process

1. **Review task description and implementation steps**
2. **Identify task characteristics** (structural vs coding vs design work)
3. **Assess complexity and risk** (low vs medium vs high)
4. **Determine validation needs** (minimal vs standard vs comprehensive)
5. **Assign task type** (Setup, Implementation, or Architecture)
6. **Add type metadata** to task in tasks.md

#### Classification Decision Examples

**Example 1: Configuration File Creation**

```markdown
Task: "Create tsconfig.json with compiler options"

Analysis:
- Structural work: Creating configuration file
- Low complexity: Standard TypeScript configuration
- Minimal logic: Copying/adapting standard config
- Low risk: Easy to verify and fix

Classification: Setup
Rationale: Preparatory structural work with clear success criteria
```

**Example 2: Token Selector Implementation**

```markdown
Task: "Implement TokenSelector class with priority logic"

Analysis:
- Coding work: Writing class methods and logic
- Medium complexity: Requires understanding token hierarchy
- Functional validation: Must verify selection logic works correctly
- Medium risk: Errors affect token selection but contained to this feature

Classification: Implementation
Rationale: Feature implementation requiring functional validation
```

**Example 3: Orchestration Architecture Design**

```markdown
Task: "Design BuildOrchestrator architecture with error handling strategy"

Analysis:
- Design work: Establishing architectural patterns
- High complexity: Affects how entire build system operates
- Design validation: Must verify extensibility and separation of concerns
- High risk: Poor decisions affect entire system

Classification: Architecture
Rationale: Architectural decisions establishing patterns for other code
```

**Example 4: Ambiguous Classification**

```markdown
Task: "Implement configuration validation logic"

Analysis:
- Could be Implementation: Writing validation code
- Could be Architecture: Designing validation strategy

Resolution: Ask human for clarification
- If implementing specific validation rules: Implementation
- If establishing validation patterns for system: Architecture

Document decision in tasks.md for future reference
```

### Guidance for AI Agents

#### Clear Classification

When task type is obvious from characteristics:
1. Assign appropriate type (Setup, Implementation, Architecture)
2. Add type metadata to task
3. Proceed with task creation

#### Unclear Classification

When task type is ambiguous:
1. Identify the ambiguity (e.g., "Could be Implementation or Architecture")
2. Prompt human: "This task could be classified as [Type A] or [Type B]. Which is more appropriate?"
3. Document human's decision and rationale
4. Consider updating Task Type Definitions if new pattern emerges

#### New Patterns

When encountering a task pattern not covered by existing definitions:
1. Classify based on closest match to existing characteristics
2. Prompt human for confirmation
3. Document the new pattern in Task Type Definitions document
4. Include date, pattern description, classification decision, and rationale

### Reference Documentation

For detailed task type definitions with comprehensive examples, see:

**Task Type Definitions**: `.kiro/steering/Task-Type-Definitions.md`

This living document provides:
- Detailed definitions for each task type
- Comprehensive examples (5+ per type)
- Validation and documentation tier specifications
- Update history tracking new patterns and classification decisions
- Guidelines for collaborative human-AI classification decisions

### Integration with Tasks Document Format

Task type metadata is included in the tasks.md format:

```markdown
- [ ] [N.1] [Sub-task Title]
  **Type**: [Setup | Implementation | Architecture]
  **Validation**: [Tier 1: Minimal | Tier 2: Standard | Tier 3: Comprehensive]
  - [Implementation step 1]
  - [Implementation step 2]
  - _Requirements: [Requirement IDs]_
```

This explicit metadata ensures AI agents know exactly which validation and documentation tier to apply during task execution.

## Rationale for Three-Tier Approach

### Overview

The three-tier system for task classification, validation, and completion documentation was developed in response to quality concerns identified through comparative analysis of two major spec executions: F1 (Mathematical Token System) and F2 (Cross-Platform Build System).

This section explains the audit findings, why the three-tier approach was chosen, and the expected impact on both quality and token efficiency.

### Background: F1 vs F2 Execution Patterns

#### F1 Approach (Original Pattern)

**Characteristics**:
- Completion documentation for 95% of subtasks (37/39)
- Validation after every subtask (~39 validation cycles)
- Average ~800 lines per completion document
- Immediate error detection after each subtask
- Comprehensive architectural documentation with code examples

**Strengths**:
- Frequent quality checkpoints
- Immediate error detection
- Comprehensive knowledge preservation
- Clear progress markers

**Weaknesses**:
- High token usage (~39,000 tokens for completion docs + validation)
- Potential over-documentation of simple tasks
- Repetitive validation for low-risk work

#### F2 Approach (Token-Optimized Pattern)

**Characteristics**:
- Completion documentation for 68% of subtasks (28/41)
- Validation only at parent task level (~10 validation cycles)
- Average ~400 lines per completion document
- Delayed error detection until parent task complete
- More concise, implementation-focused documentation

**Strengths**:
- 65% token reduction (~13,200 tokens vs ~39,000)
- Faster execution
- Less documentation overhead

**Weaknesses**:
- Delayed error detection (errors can compound)
- Fewer incremental checkpoints (harder to pinpoint issues)
- Less detailed architectural documentation
- Ambiguity about when subtask completion docs are appropriate

### Audit Findings Summary

**Quantitative Findings**:

| Metric | F1 (Original) | F2 (Optimized) | Change |
|--------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| Completion Doc Coverage | 95% | 68% | -27% |
| Validation Cycles | 39 | 10 | -75% |
| Avg Doc Length | ~800 lines | ~400 lines | -50% |
| Token Usage | ~39,000 | ~13,200 | -65% |

**Quality Impact**:
- **Delayed Error Detection**: Errors accumulate until parent task validation, making debugging more complex
- **Reduced Checkpoints**: Fewer "save points" make it harder to identify when issues were introduced
- **Less Knowledge Preservation**: Shorter docs with less architectural discussion and fewer lessons learned
- **Inconsistent Application**: Ambiguity about when subtask completion docs are appropriate

**User Experience**:
- F2 execution felt "less refined" despite successful token reduction
- Quality concerns outweighed token savings benefits
- Need for balance between quality and efficiency

### Why Three Tiers?

#### Alignment Principle

The three-tier system aligns three critical dimensions:

1. **Task Complexity** (Setup → Implementation → Architecture)
2. **Validation Depth** (Minimal → Standard → Comprehensive)
3. **Documentation Detail** (Brief → Standard → Extensive)

This alignment ensures that validation effort and documentation detail match the actual complexity and risk of the work being performed.

#### Objective Classification

Three task types provide clear, objective classification criteria:

- **Setup**: Structural work (directories, configuration, dependencies)
- **Implementation**: Coding work (features, functionality, integration)
- **Architecture**: Design work (patterns, algorithms, system structure)

This removes ambiguity about when to apply which tier, enabling consistent AI agent execution.

#### Balanced Approach

Three tiers provide the optimal balance:

**Too Few Tiers (F2's Two-Tier Approach)**:
- Simple vs Complex is subjective
- No middle ground for standard implementation work
- Forces binary decisions that don't match reality

**Too Many Tiers (Four or More)**:
- Increased cognitive load during classification
- Diminishing returns on granularity
- More complex to implement and maintain

**Three Tiers (Goldilocks Zone)**:
- Clear distinction between structural, coding, and design work
- Objective classification criteria
- Sufficient granularity without excessive complexity

### Token Impact Analysis

#### Estimated Token Usage by Tier

**Tier 1: Minimal (Setup Tasks)**:
- ~50 tokens for validation
- ~150 lines for completion documentation
- **Total per task**: ~200 tokens

**Tier 2: Standard (Implementation Tasks)**:
- ~200 tokens for validation
- ~300 lines for completion documentation
- **Total per task**: ~500 tokens

**Tier 3: Comprehensive (Architecture + Parent Tasks)**:
- ~400-600 tokens for validation
- ~600-800 lines for completion documentation
- **Total per task**: ~1,000-1,400 tokens

#### Projected Token Usage for Typical Spec

**Typical Spec Structure**:
- 10 parent tasks (Tier 3)
- 15 implementation subtasks (Tier 2)
- 10 setup subtasks (Tier 1)
- 5 architecture subtasks (Tier 3)

**Token Calculation**:
- Parent tasks: 10 × 1,200 = 12,000 tokens
- Implementation: 15 × 500 = 7,500 tokens
- Setup: 10 × 200 = 2,000 tokens
- Architecture: 5 × 1,200 = 6,000 tokens
- **Total**: ~27,500 tokens

**Comparison**:
- F1 Approach: ~39,000 tokens (validate + document everything)
- Three-Tier: ~27,500 tokens (validate + document by complexity)
- F2 Approach: ~13,200 tokens (validate + document minimally)

**Result**: Three-tier approach provides **30% token savings vs F1** while maintaining **quality checkpoints** that F2 lacked.

### Quality Improvements Over F2

#### Incremental Validation

**F2 Problem**: Validation only at parent task level allowed errors to compound

**Three-Tier Solution**: 
- Setup tasks: Minimal validation (syntax + artifacts)
- Implementation tasks: Standard validation (syntax + functional + integration)
- Architecture tasks: Comprehensive validation (syntax + functional + design + integration + edge cases)

**Benefit**: Errors caught at appropriate granularity based on task complexity

#### Completion Documentation for All Subtasks

**F2 Problem**: Only 68% of subtasks had completion docs, creating gaps in knowledge preservation

**Three-Tier Solution**: All subtasks receive completion documentation with detail appropriate to complexity

**Benefit**: 100% completion doc coverage with proportional detail

#### Objective Classification Criteria

**F2 Problem**: Ambiguity about when subtask completion docs were appropriate

**Three-Tier Solution**: Task type determined during planning phase with explicit metadata

**Benefit**: No ambiguity during execution - AI agents know exactly which tier to apply

### Decision-Making Process

#### Systematic Skepticism Applied

**Counter-Argument 1**: "F2's approach is simpler - why add complexity?"

**Response**: The simplicity of F2 came at the cost of quality. The three-tier system adds minimal complexity (just task type classification) while restoring quality checkpoints.

**Counter-Argument 2**: "Why not just revert to F1's approach?"

**Response**: F1's approach over-validated simple tasks. A setup task creating directories doesn't need comprehensive validation. The three-tier system provides appropriate validation for each complexity level.

**Counter-Argument 3**: "Three tiers is arbitrary - why not two or four?"

**Response**: Three tiers map to natural work categories (structural, coding, design) and provide sufficient granularity without excessive complexity. Two tiers force binary decisions; four tiers add cognitive load without proportional benefit.

#### Evidence-Based Validation

The three-tier approach was validated through:

1. **Quantitative Analysis**: Measured completion doc coverage, validation frequency, and token usage across F1 and F2
2. **Quality Assessment**: Identified specific quality issues (delayed error detection, reduced checkpoints, less knowledge preservation)
3. **Token Modeling**: Calculated expected token usage for three-tier approach
4. **Comparative Evaluation**: Compared three-tier approach against F1, F2, and alternative approaches

### Expected Outcomes

#### Quality Metrics

- **Completion Doc Coverage**: 100% (vs 68% in F2, 95% in F1)
- **Error Detection Timing**: Appropriate to task complexity (vs delayed in F2, immediate in F1)
- **Documentation Depth**: Proportional to complexity (vs uniform in F1/F2)
- **Classification Consistency**: >90% of tasks classified without human clarification

#### Efficiency Metrics

- **Token Usage**: ~27,500 per spec (vs ~39,000 in F1, ~13,200 in F2)
- **Token Savings vs F1**: ~30% reduction
- **Quality Improvement vs F2**: Restored incremental validation and comprehensive documentation

#### Developer Experience

- **Execution Feel**: More refined than F2 through incremental validation
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Better than F2 through comprehensive documentation for complex tasks
- **Efficiency**: Better than F1 through appropriate validation for simple tasks

## Three-Tier Validation System

### Overview

The Three-Tier Validation System aligns validation depth with task complexity and risk. Each task type (Setup, Implementation, Architecture, Parent) has a corresponding validation tier that specifies the checks required before marking a task complete.

This validation system ensures:
- **Appropriate error detection** matched to task complexity
- **Incremental quality gates** that catch issues early
- **Objective validation criteria** that AI agents can apply consistently
- **Efficient resource allocation** by avoiding over-validation of simple tasks

### Validation Principles

**Validation Depth Matches Risk**: Low-risk Setup tasks receive minimal validation, while high-risk Architecture tasks receive comprehensive validation.

**Objective Checks**: All validation checks are specific, measurable, and unambiguous.

**Incremental Validation**: Validation occurs after each task completion, not accumulated to parent level.

**Documented Results**: All validation results are documented in completion documentation with specific checks listed.

---

### Tier 1: Minimal Validation (Setup Tasks)

**Purpose**: Verify structural work is complete and syntactically correct

**When to Apply**: 
- Setup tasks (directory creation, configuration files, dependency installation)
- Low complexity, low risk work
- Clear success criteria based on artifact presence

**Required Checks**:

1. **Syntax Validation**
   - Run `getDiagnostics` to check for syntax and type errors
   - Verify no compilation errors in created files
   - Confirm all imports and references resolve correctly

2. **Artifact Verification**

### Validation Workflow

#### During Task Execution

1. **Before Starting Task**
   - Review task type and validation tier
   - Understand what validation checks will be required
   - Plan implementation to meet validation criteria

2. **During Implementation**
   - Run `getDiagnostics` frequently to catch syntax errors early
   - Test functionality incrementally
   - Verify integration points as you build

3. **After Implementation**
   - Run complete validation for the task's tier
   - Document validation results in completion documentation
   - Fix any validation failures before marking task complete

4. **Before Moving to Next Task**
   - Confirm all validation checks passed
   - Verify completion documentation includes validation results
   - Ensure no errors or warnings remain unresolved

#### Validation Failure Handling

**When validation fails at any tier**:

1. **Document the Failure**
   - Record specific validation checks that failed
   - Note error messages or unexpected behavior
   - Identify root cause of failure

2. **Fix the Issues**
   - Address syntax errors
   - Correct functional problems
   - Fix integration issues
   - Resolve design flaws

3. **Re-run Validation**
   - Execute validation checks again
   - Verify all issues are resolved
   - Confirm no new issues introduced

4. **Document Resolution**
   - Record what was fixed and how
   - Update completion documentation with final validation results
   - Note any lessons learned

**Example of Validation Failure Documentation**:

```markdown
## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Initial Validation (Failed)
❌ getDiagnostics found 2 type errors in TokenSelector.ts
  - Line 45: Property 'priority' does not exist on type 'Token'
  - Line 67: Argument of type 'string' not assignable to parameter of type 'TokenType'
❌ Functional validation: selectToken() not returning correct priority
  - Expected semantic token, got primitive token

### Resolution
- Fixed type errors: Added 'priority' property to Token interface
- Fixed type error: Changed argument type from string to TokenType enum
- Fixed priority logic: Corrected semantic token check in selectToken()

### Final Validation (Passed)
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ All imports resolve correctly
✅ Functional validation: selectToken() returns correct priority
✅ Integration validation: Works correctly with token registries
✅ Requirements compliance: All requirements addressed
```

---

### Validation Best Practices

**Use getDiagnostics First**: Always run `getDiagnostics` before other validation checks. Syntax errors must be fixed before functional validation.

**Validate Incrementally**: Don't wait until task completion to validate. Check syntax and functionality as you build.

**Document Specific Checks**: List specific validation checks performed, not just "validation passed."

**Provide Evidence**: For comprehensive validation, provide evidence (test results, examples) that checks passed.

**Fix Before Proceeding**: Never move to the next task with validation failures. Fix issues immediately.

**Learn from Failures**: Document what went wrong and how it was fixed. This helps prevent similar issues in future tasks.

## Three-Tier Completion Documentation System

### Overview

The Three-Tier Completion Documentation System aligns documentation detail with task complexity and type. Each task type (Setup, Implementation, Architecture, Parent) has a corresponding documentation tier that specifies the required sections and level of detail for completion documentation.

This documentation system ensures:
- **Appropriate documentation depth** matched to task complexity
- **Consistent documentation structure** across all tasks
- **Efficient knowledge capture** without excessive overhead
- **Clear completion artifacts** for future reference

### Documentation Principles

**Documentation Depth Matches Complexity**: Low-complexity Setup tasks receive minimal documentation, while high-complexity Architecture tasks receive comprehensive documentation.

**All Subtasks Documented**: Every subtask receives a completion document, regardless of tier.

**Structured Templates**: Each tier has a defined template with required sections.

**Evidence-Based**: Documentation includes specific evidence of completion and validation results.

---

**Example - Token Selector Implementation**:

```markdown
# Task 1.2 Completion: Implement Token Selector

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Task**: 1.2 Implement TokenSelector class with priority logic
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `src/build/TokenSelector.ts` - Token selection logic with priority handling
- `src/build/interfaces/ITokenSelector.ts` - Token selector interface

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Implemented the TokenSelector class to handle token selection with priority logic that favors semantic tokens over primitive tokens. The implementation uses a two-phase lookup strategy: first checking the semantic token registry, then falling back to the primitive token registry if needed.

The class maintains references to both registries and provides a single `selectToken()` method that encapsulates the priority logic. Error handling was added to provide clear messages when tokens are not found in either registry.

### Key Decisions

**Decision 1**: Two-phase lookup strategy
- **Rationale**: Keeps the priority logic simple and explicit - semantic tokens are always checked first
- **Alternative**: Could have used a unified registry with priority metadata, but that would complicate the registry implementation

**Decision 2**: Explicit error messages
- **Rationale**: When a token isn't found, the error message indicates which registries were checked, helping developers debug token reference issues
- **Alternative**: Could have returned null/undefined, but explicit errors are better for development experience

### Integration Points

The TokenSelector integrates with:
- `PrimitiveTokenRegistry` for primitive token lookups
- `SemanticTokenRegistry` for semantic token lookups
- `BuildOrchestrator` which uses TokenSelector to resolve token references during generation

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ All imports resolve correctly
✅ Type annotations correct

### Functional Validation
✅ selectToken() returns semantic token when available
✅ selectToken() falls back to primitive token when semantic unavailable
✅ selectToken() throws clear error when token not found in either registry
✅ Priority logic correctly favors semantic over primitive

### Integration Validation
✅ Integrates with PrimitiveTokenRegistry correctly
✅ Integrates with SemanticTokenRegistry correctly
✅ Method signatures match BuildOrchestrator expectations
✅ Return types compatible with downstream consumers

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 9.1: Token selection priority logic implemented (semantic > primitive)
✅ Requirement 9.2: Fallback mechanism implemented for missing semantic tokens
✅ Requirement 9.3: Error handling provides actionable messages for invalid references

**Example - Parent Task Completion**:

```markdown
# Task 1 Completion: Build System Foundation

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Task**: 1. Build System Foundation
**Type**: Parent
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `src/build/` directory structure
- `src/build/TokenSelector.ts` - Token selection with priority logic
- `src/build/BuildOrchestrator.ts` - Build orchestration architecture
- `src/build/interfaces/` - All build system interfaces
- `src/build/platforms/` - Platform generator structure

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Orchestration Pattern

**Options Considered**:
1. Monolithic builder - Single class handling all build logic
2. Pipeline pattern - Sequential stages with data passing
3. Orchestrator pattern - Coordinator delegating to specialized components

**Decision**: Orchestrator pattern

**Rationale**: 
The orchestrator pattern provides the best balance of separation of concerns and coordination. The BuildOrchestrator coordinates between token selection, platform-specific generation, and file writing without implementing any of these concerns itself. This makes the system highly extensible - new platforms can be added by implementing the platform generator interface without modifying the orchestrator.

The pattern also provides clear error handling boundaries. Each component (TokenSelector, platform generators, file writers) can fail independently, and the orchestrator can handle these failures with appropriate recovery strategies.

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Clear separation of concerns, high extensibility, testable components
- ❌ **Lost**: Some simplicity - more classes and interfaces than monolithic approach
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Coordination complexity if many components need to interact

**Counter-Arguments**:
- **Argument**: Pipeline pattern would be simpler and more functional
- **Response**: Pipeline pattern works well for linear data transformations, but our build process has branching logic (different platforms) and error recovery needs that fit better with orchestration

### Decision 2: Token Selection Priority

**Options Considered**:
1. Unified registry with priority metadata
2. Two-phase lookup (semantic first, then primitive)
3. Configuration-driven priority

**Decision**: Two-phase lookup

**Rationale**:
Two-phase lookup makes the priority explicit in code rather than hidden in configuration or metadata. When reading the TokenSelector code, it's immediately clear that semantic tokens are checked first, then primitive tokens. This explicitness helps developers understand the system behavior without needing to trace through configuration or metadata.

The approach also keeps the registries simple - they don't need to know about priority, they just store and retrieve tokens. Priority is a concern of the selector, not the storage.

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Explicit priority logic, simple registries, clear code flow
- ❌ **Lost**: Flexibility to change priority without code changes
- ⚠️ **Risk**: If priority rules become complex, two-phase lookup might not scale

**Counter-Arguments**:
- **Argument**: Configuration-driven priority would be more flexible
- **Response**: Priority is a core architectural decision, not a configuration concern. Making it explicit in code is appropriate for this level of system behavior.

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Built the foundation in three phases:
1. Directory structure and interfaces (Task 1.1)
2. Token selection logic (Task 1.2)
3. Orchestration architecture (Task 1.3)

This bottom-up approach ensured each component was solid before building the coordination layer. The interfaces were defined first to establish clear contracts between components.

### Key Patterns

**Pattern 1**: Strategy Pattern for Platform Generators
- Each platform implements the same interface
- Orchestrator doesn't know about platform-specific details
- New platforms can be added without modifying orchestrator

**Pattern 2**: Dependency Injection
- Orchestrator receives registries and generators as constructor parameters
- Makes testing easier and dependencies explicit
- Allows for different configurations in different contexts

## Validation (Tier 3: Comprehensive - Parent Task)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors across all artifacts
✅ All imports resolve correctly
✅ Type annotations correct throughout

### Functional Validation

✅ Error handling works for all failure scenarios

### Design Validation
✅ Architecture supports extensibility - new platforms can be added via interface
✅ Separation of concerns maintained - selection, generation, writing are separate
✅ Strategy pattern applied correctly for platform-specific generation
✅ Abstractions appropriate - orchestrator coordinates, doesn't implement

### System Integration
✅ All subtasks integrate correctly with each other
✅ TokenSelector integrates with both registries
✅ BuildOrchestrator integrates with TokenSelector and generators
✅ No conflicts between subtask implementations

### Edge Cases
✅ Missing tokens handled gracefully with clear errors
✅ File write failures trigger rollback mechanism
✅ Invalid platform specifications caught early
✅ Error messages provide actionable guidance

### Subtask Integration
✅ Task 1.1 (directory structure) provides foundation for Task 1.2 and 1.3
✅ Task 1.2 (TokenSelector) integrates seamlessly with Task 1.3 (orchestrator)
✅ All interfaces defined in Task 1.1 properly implemented in Tasks 1.2 and 1.3

## Success Criteria Verification

### Criterion 1: Build system foundation established

**Evidence**: BuildOrchestrator successfully coordinates token selection, platform-specific generation, and file writing in a single orchestrate() call.

**Verification**:
- Created complete directory structure for build system
- Implemented TokenSelector with priority logic
- Implemented BuildOrchestrator with coordination logic
- All components integrate correctly

**Example**: 
```typescript
const orchestrator = new BuildOrchestrator(
  primitiveRegistry,
  semanticRegistry,
  platformGenerators
);
const result = orchestrator.orchestrate('web');
// Successfully generates web platform files
```

### Criterion 2: Platform-specific generation working

**Evidence**: Build system can generate files for web, iOS, and Android platforms with correct platform-specific formatting.

**Verification**:
- Platform generator interface defined
- Structure in place for platform-specific generators
- Orchestrator delegates to appropriate generator based on platform
- Generated files follow platform conventions

**Example**: Web generates CSS, iOS generates Swift, Android generates Kotlin - all from same token source.

### Criterion 3: Error handling comprehensive

**Evidence**: All error scenarios tested and handled with appropriate recovery strategies.

**Verification**:
- Token not found errors provide clear messages
- File write failures trigger rollback
- Invalid platform specifications caught early
- All error paths tested

**Example**: When a token reference is invalid, error message indicates which registries were checked and suggests valid alternatives.

## Overall Integration Story

### Complete Workflow

The build system foundation enables a complete workflow from token definition to platform-specific file generation:

1. **Token Selection**: TokenSelector resolves token references by checking semantic registry first, then falling back to primitive registry
2. **Platform Generation**: BuildOrchestrator delegates to platform-specific generators based on target platform
3. **File Writing**: Generated content is written to appropriate platform directories
4. **Error Recovery**: Any failures trigger appropriate error handling and rollback

This workflow is coordinated by the BuildOrchestrator, which maintains clear separation between these concerns while ensuring they work together correctly.

### Subtask Contributions

**Task 1.1**: Create directory structure
- Established organizational foundation for build system
- Defined clear separation between interfaces, platform code, and orchestration
- Provided structure that guides future development

**Task 1.2**: Implement TokenSelector
- Implemented priority logic for token resolution
- Provided clear interface for token lookup
- Handles fallback and error cases gracefully

**Task 1.3**: Design BuildOrchestrator architecture
- Established coordination pattern for build process
- Defined clear interfaces for platform generators
- Implemented error handling and recovery strategies

### System Behavior

The build system now provides a unified interface for generating platform-specific files from design tokens. Developers can call `orchestrator.orchestrate(platform)` and receive platform-appropriate files without needing to understand the internal coordination logic.

The system prioritizes semantic tokens over primitive tokens, ensuring that design intent (semantic) is preferred over raw values (primitive) when both are available. This supports the design system's goal of maintaining semantic meaning across platforms.

### User-Facing Capabilities

Developers can now:
- Generate platform-specific token files with a single command
- Rely on automatic token resolution with semantic priority
- Receive clear error messages when token references are invalid
- Trust that the system handles platform-specific formatting correctly

## Requirements Compliance

✅ Requirement 1.1: Build system foundation with clear architecture
✅ Requirement 6.3: Comprehensive error handling strategy
✅ Requirement 8.2: Extensibility for new platforms via interface
✅ Requirement 9.1: Token selection priority (semantic > primitive)
✅ Requirement 9.2: Fallback mechanism for missing semantic tokens
✅ Requirement 9.3: Clear error messages for invalid references

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

- **Bottom-up approach**: Building interfaces first, then implementations, ensured clear contracts
- **Explicit priority logic**: Two-phase lookup made token selection behavior obvious
- **Orchestrator pattern**: Provided excellent separation of concerns and extensibility

### Challenges

- **Coordination complexity**: Ensuring all components work together required careful interface design
  - **Resolution**: Defined interfaces early and validated integration points incrementally
- **Error handling boundaries**: Determining which component should handle which errors
  - **Resolution**: Established clear ownership - components detect errors, orchestrator handles recovery

### Future Considerations

- **Performance optimization**: Current implementation prioritizes clarity over performance
  - Could add caching layer for token lookups if performance becomes an issue
- **Configuration flexibility**: Priority logic is hardcoded
  - Could make configurable if different priority strategies are needed
- **Parallel generation**: Currently generates platforms sequentially
  - Could parallelize for better performance with many platforms

## Integration Points

### Dependencies

- **PrimitiveTokenRegistry**: TokenSelector depends on this for primitive token lookups
- **SemanticTokenRegistry**: TokenSelector depends on this for semantic token lookups
- **Platform Generators**: BuildOrchestrator depends on these for platform-specific generation

### Dependents

- **Build CLI**: Will depend on BuildOrchestrator to trigger builds
- **Watch Mode**: Will depend on BuildOrchestrator for incremental builds
- **Test Utilities**: Will depend on these components for testing token generation

### Extension Points

- **New Platforms**: Add by implementing platform generator interface
- **Custom Token Resolution**: Could extend TokenSelector for custom priority logic
- **Build Plugins**: Could add plugin system to BuildOrchestrator for custom build steps

### API Surface

**TokenSelector**:
- `selectToken(tokenName: string): Token` - Main token resolution method

**BuildOrchestrator**:
- `orchestrate(platform: string): BuildResult` - Main build coordination method
- `rollback(): void` - Error recovery method
```

### Documentation Workflow

#### During Task Execution

1. **Start Documentation Early**
   - Create completion document when starting task
   - Add notes as you implement
   - Document decisions as they're made

2. **Document Incrementally**
   - Add to completion doc throughout implementation
   - Don't wait until end to write everything
   - Capture insights while they're fresh

3. **Use Appropriate Tier**
   - Check task type to determine documentation tier
   - Follow template for that tier
   - Include all required sections

4. **Provide Evidence**
   - Include specific examples
   - Reference validation results
   - Show concrete outcomes

#### After Task Completion

1. **Review Completeness**
   - Verify all required sections present
   - Check that validation results documented
   - Confirm requirements compliance listed

2. **Review Clarity**
   - Ensure decisions are clearly explained
   - Verify examples are helpful
   - Check that future readers will understand

3. **File Organization**
   - Save to `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/`
   - Use naming convention: `task-[N]-completion.md` or `task-[N.M]-completion.md`
   - Add organization metadata: `spec-completion`

### Documentation Best Practices

**Write for Future You**: Document as if you'll need to understand this in 6 months without any context.

**Be Specific**: "Implemented token selection" is vague. "Implemented two-phase token lookup prioritizing semantic over primitive tokens" is specific.

**Document Decisions**: Don't just document what you did - document why you did it that way.

**Include Counter-Arguments**: For architecture tasks, document why alternative approaches were rejected.

**Provide Examples**: Concrete examples make documentation much more useful than abstract descriptions.

**Link to Requirements**: Always reference which requirements are addressed by the work.

**Capture Lessons**: Document what you learned, what was challenging, and what you'd do differently.

## Spec Workflow

### Phase 1: Requirements

1. Generate initial requirements based on feature idea
2. Use EARS format for acceptance criteria
3. Include user stories for context
4. Get user approval before proceeding

### Phase 2: Design

1. Create architecture based on requirements
2. Define components and interfaces
3. Document design decisions with rationale
4. Apply systematic skepticism (counter-arguments)
5. Get user approval before proceeding

### Phase 3: Tasks

1. Convert design into actionable coding tasks
2. Use hierarchical format (primary + sub-tasks)
3. **Classify task types** for each subtask:
   - Review task characteristics (structural vs coding vs design work)
   - Assess complexity and risk (low vs medium vs high)
   - Assign task type (Setup, Implementation, or Architecture)
   - Add **Type** and **Validation** metadata to each subtask
   - Reference **Task Type Definitions** (`.kiro/steering/Task-Type-Definitions.md`) for classification guidance
   - Prompt human for clarification if task type is ambiguous
4. Add success criteria at primary task level
5. Include artifacts and completion documentation paths
6. Get user approval before implementation

### Phase 4: Implementation

1. **Before starting task**: Review task type and validation tier requirements
2. Execute tasks incrementally (one at a time)
3. Mark tasks in progress, then complete
4. **Validate by tier** before marking complete:
   - **Tier 1 (Setup)**: Syntax validation + artifact verification + basic structure
   - **Tier 2 (Implementation)**: Syntax + functional + integration + requirements compliance
   - **Tier 3 (Architecture/Parent)**: Syntax + functional + design + system integration + edge cases + requirements
   - Fix any validation failures before proceeding
5. **Create completion documentation** using appropriate tier format:
   - **Tier 1 (Setup)**: Minimal format - artifacts, notes, validation
   - **Tier 2 (Implementation)**: Standard format - artifacts, details, validation, requirements
   - **Tier 3 (Architecture/Parent)**: Comprehensive format - artifacts, decisions, algorithm, validation, lessons, integration
6. Commit using task completion hook (automatic)
7. Verify all validation checks passed before moving to next task

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Requirements Anti-Patterns

❌ **Implementation details in requirements** - Focus on behavior, not how  
❌ **Vague acceptance criteria** - Must be specific and testable  
❌ **Missing user stories** - Context helps understand intent  
❌ **Arbitrary metrics** - Validate metrics are achievable and meaningful

### Design Anti-Patterns

❌ **No architecture diagram** - Visual representation helps understanding  
❌ **Undocumented design decisions** - Future you needs to know why  
❌ **No trade-off analysis** - Every decision has costs  
❌ **Missing systematic skepticism** - Challenge assumptions with counter-arguments

### Tasks Anti-Patterns

❌ **Success criteria on every sub-task** - Repetitive and token-heavy  
❌ **Post-complete in tasks** - Redundant with hook automation  
❌ **Vague implementation steps** - Be specific about what to build  
❌ **Missing artifacts** - Hard to know what files should exist  
❌ **No completion documentation** - Learnings get lost

## Conditional Loading Pattern

This document uses **conditional loading** - it's only loaded when AI agents are creating or updating specs.

**Trigger conditions**:
- User asks to create a new spec
- User asks to update existing spec documents
- AI agent is in spec planning workflow

**Not loaded when**:
- Executing implementation tasks
- Regular development work
- Non-spec-related activities

**This pattern**:
- Saves tokens for irrelevant work
- Ensures standards applied when needed
- Keeps context focused and relevant
- Scales to other conditional guidance

---

*This document provides the standards for creating well-structured, actionable specifications that enable systematic feature development while maintaining quality and consistency across all specs.*
