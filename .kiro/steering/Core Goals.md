## Core Project Context
- This is the DesignerPunk design system - a True Native cross-platform design system with mathematical foundations
- Focus on build-time platform separation (web/iOS/Android) rather than runtime detection
- Follows a REM-style and baseline grid structure with a modular scale mathematical foundation
- Prioritize accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) and cross-platform consistency
- Use the established True Native and Token architecture patterns documented in the project
- Development with Human-AI collaboration and partnership at a foundational value

## Development Practices
- Follow systematic task completion workflow with automated git integration
- Use hook system for consistent commit practices: `./.kiro/hooks/commit-task.sh "Task Name"`
- Maintain concept-based documentation approach preventing contamination vectors
- Apply process-first tool development: prove manual processes before automation
- Always prioritize using design tokens over hard coded values. If hard values are necessary, AI Agents should inform their Human partner.
- All created tokens must work within the Rosetta System: mathematical relationships, unitless cross-platform values, and primitive→semantic hierarchy
- Prioritize using appropriate semantic tokens before using primitive tokens.
