# File Organization Standards

**Date**: January 10, 2025  
**Purpose**: Metadata-driven file organization system for sustainable project structure  
**Organization**: process-standard  
**Scope**: cross-project  
**Approach**: Process-first tool development with human-controlled organization

---

## File Organization Philosophy

### Metadata-Driven Organization
All files use explicit metadata to declare organizational intent, enabling safe automation while maintaining human control over organizational decisions.

### Organization Principles
- **Explicit Intent**: Human declares organization purpose through metadata
- **Reusability Focus**: Framework-level artifacts separated from spec-specific artifacts
- **Context Preservation**: Related artifacts grouped for efficient navigation
- **Scalable Structure**: Organization patterns work as project grows

---

## Required Metadata Fields

### Standard Metadata Header
```markdown
# Document Title

**Date**: Creation date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
**Purpose**: Clear description of document purpose and scope
**Organization**: Intended organization level (see values below)
**Scope**: Applicable scope or spec name
**Status**: Current document status (optional)
**Task**: Associated task number and name (if applicable)
```

### Organization Field Values

#### Framework-Level Artifacts
```markdown
**Organization**: framework-strategic
**Scope**: cross-spec
```
**Purpose**: Reusable strategic guidance that applies across multiple specs
**Location**: `strategic-framework/` directory
**Examples**: North star vision, system catalogs, prioritization matrices

#### Spec-Specific Validation
```markdown
**Organization**: spec-validation
**Scope**: [spec-name]
```
**Purpose**: Validation artifacts specific to one spec's development
**Location**: `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/validation/` directory
**Examples**: Framework validation reports, cross-reference validation, gap analysis

#### Spec-Specific Completion
```markdown
**Organization**: spec-completion
**Scope**: [spec-name]
```
**Purpose**: Completion documentation for specific tasks or specs
**Location**: `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/` directory
**Examples**: Task completion documentation, lessons learned, implementation notes

**Completion Documentation Standards**:
- **All Subtasks**: Completion documents are created for all subtasks, regardless of task type (Setup, Implementation, Architecture)
- **Naming Convention**: 
  - Parent tasks: `task-[N]-completion.md` (e.g., `task-1-completion.md`, `task-2-completion.md`)
  - Subtasks: `task-[N.M]-completion.md` (e.g., `task-1-1-completion.md`, `task-2-3-completion.md`)
- **Organization Metadata**: All completion documents use `**Organization**: spec-completion`
- **Location**: All completion documents stored in `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/` directory

**Naming Convention Examples**:
```
.kiro/specs/cross-platform-build-system/completion/
├── task-1-completion.md           # Parent task 1 completion
├── task-1-1-completion.md         # Subtask 1.1 completion
├── task-1-2-completion.md         # Subtask 1.2 completion
├── task-1-3-completion.md         # Subtask 1.3 completion
├── task-2-completion.md           # Parent task 2 completion
├── task-2-1-completion.md         # Subtask 2.1 completion
└── task-2-2-completion.md         # Subtask 2.2 completion
```

#### Summary Documents
```markdown
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: [spec-name]
```
**Purpose**: Concise, commit-style summaries of parent task completion that trigger release detection hooks and serve as release note content
**Location**: `docs/specs/[spec-name]/` directory
**Examples**: Parent task summaries that trigger automatic release detection

**Summary Document Standards**:
- **Naming Convention**: `task-N-summary.md` (e.g., `task-1-summary.md`, `task-2-summary.md`, `task-10-summary.md`)
- **Organization Metadata**: All summary documents use `**Organization**: spec-summary`
- **Location**: All summary documents stored in `docs/specs/[spec-name]/` directory
- **Purpose**: Dual purpose as hook trigger and release note content
- **Relationship to Detailed Docs**: Summary docs complement detailed completion docs in `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/`

**Hook Limitation**: Kiro IDE's `fileCreated` and `fileSaved` hooks only trigger for **manual file operations through the IDE UI**, not for programmatically created files by AI agents. This requires a hybrid approach:
- **Automatic hooks**: Work for manually created/edited files through IDE UI
- **Manual trigger**: Required for AI-assisted workflows after summary document creation

**Rationale**:
- **Hook Triggering**: The `.kiro/` directory is filtered from Kiro IDE's file watching system. Summary documents in `docs/specs/` enable automatic release detection for manual file operations.
- **Dual Purpose**: Summary documents serve both as hook triggers and as concise, public-facing release note content.
- **Clear Separation**: Detailed completion docs (internal knowledge preservation) remain in `.kiro/`, while summaries (public-facing) live in `docs/`.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Automatic hooks for manual edits, manual trigger for AI workflows ensures release detection works in all scenarios.

**Example Metadata Header**:
```markdown
# Task 1 Summary: Fix Release Detection Triggers

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Purpose**: Concise summary of parent task completion
**Organization**: spec-summary
**Scope**: release-detection-trigger-fix

## What Was Done

[Concise description of what was implemented]

## Why It Matters

[Business value, user impact, or technical benefit]

## Key Changes

- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]
- [Change 3]

## Impact

- ✅ [Positive impact 1]
- ✅ [Positive impact 2]
```

**Cross-References Between Summary and Detailed Docs**:

Summary documents and detailed completion documents should cross-reference each other to enable easy navigation between public-facing summaries and comprehensive internal documentation.

**From Summary to Detailed Docs**:

Summary documents should include a link to the detailed completion document at the end, providing readers a path to comprehensive implementation notes.

Format:
```markdown
---

*For detailed implementation notes, see [task-N-parent-completion.md](../../.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/task-N-parent-completion.md)*
```

Example from `docs/specs/release-detection-trigger-fix/task-1-summary.md`:
```markdown
---

*For detailed implementation notes, see [task-1-parent-completion.md](../../.kiro/specs/release-detection-trigger-fix/completion/task-1-parent-completion.md)*
```

**From Detailed Docs to Summary (Optional)**:

Detailed completion documents can optionally link to the summary document, though this is less critical since detailed docs are the primary reference.

Format:
```markdown
## Related Documentation

- [Task N Summary](../../../../docs/specs/[spec-name]/task-N-summary.md) - Public-facing summary that triggered release detection
```

Example from `.kiro/specs/release-detection-trigger-fix/completion/task-1-parent-completion.md`:
```markdown
## Related Documentation

- [Task 1 Summary](../../../../docs/specs/release-detection-trigger-fix/task-1-summary.md) - Public-facing summary that triggered release detection
```

**In Tasks.md**:

Parent tasks should reference both documentation types in the "Completion Documentation" section to make it clear that two documents will be created.

Format:
```markdown
**Completion Documentation:**
- Detailed: `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/task-[N]-parent-completion.md`
- Summary: `docs/specs/[spec-name]/task-[N]-summary.md` (triggers release detection)
```

Example:
```markdown
**Completion Documentation:**
- Detailed: `.kiro/specs/release-detection-trigger-fix/completion/task-1-parent-completion.md`
- Summary: `docs/specs/release-detection-trigger-fix/task-1-summary.md` (triggers release detection)
```

**Relative Path Calculation**:

When creating cross-references, calculate relative paths based on the source document location:

- **From summary to detailed**: Summary docs are in `docs/specs/[spec-name]/`, detailed docs are in `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/`
  - Path: `../../.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/task-N-parent-completion.md`
  - Breakdown: `../..` (up to root) → `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/` (down to target)

- **From detailed to summary**: Detailed docs are in `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/`, summary docs are in `docs/specs/[spec-name]/`
  - Path: `../../../../docs/specs/[spec-name]/task-N-summary.md`
  - Breakdown: `../../../..` (up to root) → `docs/specs/[spec-name]/` (down to target)

**Best Practices**:

- Always use relative paths (not absolute paths) for cross-references
- Include descriptive link text that explains what the linked document contains
- Test links by clicking them in rendered markdown to verify they work
- Update cross-references if files are moved during organization

#### Process Standards
```markdown
**Organization**: process-standard
**Scope**: cross-project
```
**Purpose**: Reusable process documentation and standards
**Location**: `.kiro/steering/` or `docs/processes/` directory
**Examples**: Development workflows, quality standards, methodology documentation

#### Working Documents
```markdown
**Organization**: working-document
**Scope**: temporary
```
**Purpose**: Temporary files during active development
**Location**: Root directory (temporary) or appropriate working directory
**Examples**: Draft documents, experimental files, temporary analysis

```

### Spec-Specific Organization

**Two-Directory Structure**: Spec documentation is organized across two directories to enable automatic release detection while maintaining comprehensive internal documentation.

```
docs/specs/[spec-name]/                   # Public-facing documentation (TRIGGERS HOOKS)
├── task-1-summary.md                     # ✅ Parent task summary (triggers release detection)
├── task-2-summary.md                     # ✅ Parent task summary (triggers release detection)
└── task-N-summary.md                     # ✅ Parent task summary (triggers release detection)
                                          # Format: task-N-summary.md (N = parent task number)
                                          # Purpose: Concise, commit-style summaries
                                          # Hook Pattern: **/task-*-summary.md
                                          # Kiro IDE watches this directory for file creation

.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/                  # Internal documentation (NO HOOK TRIGGERS)
├── requirements.md                        # ❌ Spec requirements (no hook trigger)
├── design.md                             # ❌ Spec design (no hook trigger)
├── tasks.md                              # ❌ Implementation tasks (no hook trigger)
├── validation/                           # ❌ Spec-specific validation artifacts (no hook trigger)
│   ├── framework-validation-report.md    # Validation against preserved knowledge
│   ├── cross-reference-validation.md     # Link integrity verification
│   └── [other-validation-files].md       # Additional validation artifacts
└── completion/                           # ❌ Spec-specific completion documentation (no hook trigger)
    ├── task-1-parent-completion.md       # Parent task detailed docs (Tier 3 comprehensive)
    ├── task-1-1-completion.md            # Subtask completion docs
    ├── task-1-2-completion.md            # Subtask completion docs
    ├── task-2-parent-completion.md       # Parent task detailed docs (Tier 3 comprehensive)
    ├── task-2-1-completion.md            # Subtask completion docs
    └── spec-completion-summary.md        # Overall spec completion documentation
                                          # .kiro/ directory is filtered from Kiro IDE file watching
```

**Key Distinctions**:

| Location | Purpose | Hook Trigger | Audience |
|----------|---------|--------------|----------|
| `docs/specs/[spec-name]/` | Concise summaries | ✅ Yes | Public-facing, release notes |
| `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/` | Comprehensive docs | ❌ No | Internal, knowledge preservation |

**Why Two Directories?**:
- **Hook Triggering**: The `.kiro/` directory is filtered from Kiro IDE's file watching system. Summary documents in `docs/specs/` enable automatic release detection when created.
- **Dual Purpose**: Summary documents serve both as hook triggers and as concise, public-facing release note content.
- **Clear Separation**: Detailed completion docs (internal knowledge preservation) remain in `.kiro/`, while summaries (public-facing) live in `docs/`.

**File Naming Patterns**:
- **Summary docs**: `task-N-summary.md` (e.g., `task-1-summary.md`, `task-2-summary.md`, `task-10-summary.md`)
- **Detailed parent docs**: `task-N-parent-completion.md` (e.g., `task-1-parent-completion.md`)
- **Subtask docs**: `task-N.M-completion.md` (e.g., `task-1-1-completion.md`, `task-2-3-completion.md`)

### Process Documentation
```

## Organization Implementation

### Manual Organization Process

#### Step 1: Add Organization Metadata
When creating any new file, include organization metadata in the header:
```markdown
**Organization**: [appropriate-value]
**Scope**: [relevant-scope]
```

#### Step 2: Place in Appropriate Directory
- **framework-strategic**: Move to `strategic-framework/` directory
- **spec-validation**: Move to `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/validation/` directory
- **spec-completion**: Move to `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/` directory
- **spec-summary**: Move to `docs/specs/[spec-name]/` directory
- **process-standard**: Keep in `.kiro/steering/` or move to `docs/processes/`
- **working-document**: Keep in root or appropriate working directory

#### Step 3: Update Cross-References
After moving files, update any cross-reference links to reflect new locations.

### Hook-Assisted Organization (Future)

#### Metadata-Driven Hook
```bash
# .kiro/hooks/organize-by-metadata.sh
# Parse files for **Organization** metadata
# Move files based on explicit metadata values
# Update cross-references automatically
# Validate organization completed successfully
```

#### Enhanced Commit Hook
```bash
# .kiro/hooks/commit-task-organized.sh "Task Name" [--organize]
# Optional organization during task completion
# Human-controlled with hook assistance
# Maintains fallback to current behavior
```

## Cross-Reference Standards

### Overview

Cross-references are markdown links that connect related documentation, enabling efficient navigation between guides, specs, completion documents, and other active documentation. This section defines when and how to use cross-references to create a well-connected documentation network while maintaining clean, focused production code.

### When to Use Cross-References

Cross-references MUST be used in the following documentation types:

- **Documentation Guides**: Spec-specific guides that explain implementation patterns (e.g., `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/[guide-name].md`)
- **Spec Documents**: Requirements, design, and tasks documents in `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/`
- **Completion Documents**: Task completion documentation in `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/`
- **README Files**: Project and directory README files that provide navigation and context
- **Overview Documents**: Master documents that map components to their documentation (e.g., `docs/token-system-overview.md`)
- **Process Documentation**: Standards and methodology documents in `.kiro/steering/` and `docs/processes/`

**Rationale**: These are documentation artifacts where cross-references add value by helping readers discover related information and navigate between connected concepts.

### When NOT to Use Cross-References

Cross-references MUST NOT be used in the following production code files:

- **Token Definition Files**: Files like `FontSizeTokens.ts`, `TypographyTokens.ts`, `SpacingTokens.ts`
- **Component Implementation Files**: React components, SwiftUI views, Jetpack Compose components
- **Utility Function Files**: Helper functions, validators, converters, generators
- **Type Definition Files**: TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
- **Configuration Files**: Build configs, test configs, linting configs

**Rationale**: Production code should be focused on implementation, not documentation navigation. Code comments should be brief and implementation-focused. Architectural rationale and design decisions belong in documentation guides, not in code files. Cross-references in code create noise and distract from the implementation.

### Documentation vs Code Distinction

The key distinction is between **documentation** (where cross-references belong) and **production code** (where they don't):

**Documentation Purpose**: Explain concepts, provide context, connect related ideas, guide understanding
- Cross-references help readers navigate between related documentation
- Links provide efficient discovery of relevant information
- Navigation aids enhance learning and comprehension

**Code Purpose**: Implement functionality, execute logic, deliver features
- Code comments should be brief and implementation-focused
- Architectural rationale belongs in documentation guides, not code
- Cross-references in code create maintenance burden and distraction

**Example - CORRECT Usage (Documentation)**:
```markdown
# Typography Token Guide

## Related Guides

- [Compositional Color Guide](./compositional-color-guide.md) - Explains why typography tokens don't include color
- [Strategic Flexibility Guide](./strategic-flexibility-guide.md) - Explains size variant decisions

## Typography Token Architecture

Typography tokens combine fontSize, lineHeight, fontFamily, fontWeight, and letterSpacing primitives...
```

**Example - INCORRECT Usage (Production Code)**:
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Don't add cross-references in production code
/**
 * Typography tokens for the design system.
 * 
 * For architectural rationale, see:
 * - .kiro/specs/typography-token-expansion/compositional-color-guide.md
 * - .kiro/specs/typography-token-expansion/strategic-flexibility-guide.md
 */
export const TypographyTokens = {
  body: { fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 24, ... }
};

// ✅ CORRECT - Brief, implementation-focused comment
/**
 * Typography tokens combining fontSize, lineHeight, fontFamily, fontWeight, and letterSpacing.
 */
export const TypographyTokens = {
  body: { fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 24, ... }
};
```

### How to Format Cross-References

Cross-references should follow consistent formatting patterns to ensure clarity and maintainability. This section documents the standard patterns for relative paths, section anchors, descriptive link text, and section organization.

#### Relative Path Usage

Always use relative paths from the current document location. Relative paths ensure links remain valid when the repository structure changes or when viewing documentation in different contexts.

**Pattern**: Use `../` to navigate up directories and `./` for same-directory references

**Examples**:
```markdown
# From .kiro/specs/spec-a/guide.md to .kiro/specs/spec-b/guide.md
[Related Guide](../spec-b/guide.md)

# From docs/overview.md to .kiro/specs/spec-a/guide.md
[Implementation Guide](../.kiro/specs/spec-a/guide.md)

# From .kiro/specs/spec-a/guide-1.md to .kiro/specs/spec-a/guide-2.md
[Related Guide](./guide-2.md)
```

**Rationale**: Relative paths work across different viewing contexts (GitHub, local filesystem, documentation sites) and remain valid when the repository is cloned or moved.

#### Section Anchor Usage

Link to specific sections within documents using markdown section anchors. Section anchors are automatically generated from heading text by converting to lowercase and replacing spaces with hyphens.

**Pattern**: `[Link Text](./document.md#section-name)`

**Examples**:
```markdown
# Link to section in same directory
[Compositional Architecture](./compositional-color-guide.md#compositional-architecture)

# Link to section in parent directory
[Design Decisions](../design.md#design-decisions)

# Link to section in different spec
[Three-Tier Validation](../cross-platform-build-system/design.md#three-tier-validation-system)
```

**Rationale**: Section anchors enable precise navigation to relevant content within longer documents, improving reader efficiency and reducing cognitive load.

#### Descriptive Link Text with Relevance Explanation

Use descriptive link text that clearly identifies the target document, followed by a brief explanation of why the link is relevant. This pattern helps readers decide whether to follow the link.

**Pattern**: `[Descriptive Document Name](./path/to/document.md) - Brief explanation of relevance`

**Examples**:
```markdown
# ✅ GOOD - Explains relevance
[Strategic Flexibility Guide](./strategic-flexibility-guide.md) - Explains why labelXs exists but bodyXs doesn't
[Migration Guide](./migration-guide.md) - Provides migration path for renamed tokens
[Compositional Color Guide](./compositional-color-guide.md) - Explains why typography tokens don't include color

# ❌ BAD - No context for relevance
[Strategic Flexibility Guide](./strategic-flexibility-guide.md)
[Click here](./migration-guide.md)
[See this document](./compositional-color-guide.md)
```

**Rationale**: Relevance explanations help readers understand the relationship between documents and make informed decisions about which links to follow, improving documentation navigation efficiency.

#### "Related Guides" or "Related Documentation" Section Format

Group multiple cross-references in a dedicated section at the beginning or end of the document. Use consistent section naming ("Related Guides" for guides, "Related Documentation" for broader references) and format each link as a list item.

**Pattern**:
```markdown
## Related Guides

- [Document Name](./path/to/document.md) - Relevance explanation
- [Document Name](./path/to/document.md) - Relevance explanation
- [Document Name](./path/to/document.md) - Relevance explanation

---

## [Main Content Section]
```

**Complete Example**:
```markdown
# Typography Token Architecture Guide

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Purpose**: Explain typography token composition and design decisions
**Organization**: spec-guide
**Scope**: typography-token-expansion

## Design Decisions

### Decision: Compositional Architecture

We chose to compose typography tokens from primitives rather than including all properties...

[Content continues...]
```

**Rationale**: Grouping related links in a dedicated section provides clear navigation points without interrupting the main content flow. Placing the section at the beginning helps readers discover related documentation before diving into the current document.

### Common Cross-Reference Patterns

This section documents the three most common cross-reference patterns used in DesignerPunk documentation, with complete markdown syntax examples for each pattern. These patterns provide consistent approaches for connecting related documentation across different contexts.

#### Pattern 1: Guide-to-Guide (Related Concepts)

**Use Case**: Connect documentation guides that discuss related concepts, enabling readers to navigate between guides that explain different aspects of the same system or feature.

**When to Use**:
- Linking between spec-specific guides within the same spec
- Connecting guides that explain complementary architectural concepts
- Referencing guides that provide additional context for design decisions
- Creating bidirectional navigation between related documentation

**Markdown Syntax**:
```markdown
# Compositional Color Guide

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Purpose**: Explain compositional color architecture in typography tokens
**Organization**: spec-guide
**Scope**: typography-token-expansion

---

## Related Guides

- [Strategic Flexibility Guide](./strategic-flexibility-guide.md) - Explains size variant decisions related to compositional architecture
- [Inline Emphasis Guide](./inline-emphasis-guide.md) - Explains why emphasis isn't in tokens, relates to compositional architecture
- [Migration Guide](./migration-guide.md) - Provides migration path for renamed tokens

---

## Compositional Architecture

Typography tokens follow a compositional architecture where properties are separated by concern.
Instead of including color properties in typography tokens, color is applied separately through
semantic color tokens. This allows the same typography token to be used with different colors
in different contexts.

[Guide content continues...]
```

**Key Elements**:
- **Related Guides section**: Placed at the beginning after metadata
- **Relative paths**: Use `./` for same-directory references
- **Relevance explanations**: Brief description of why each guide is relevant
- **Separator**: Use `---` to separate Related Guides from main content
- **Bidirectional**: Each guide should reference related guides that reference it back

**Example from Different Spec**:
```markdown
# Build System Architecture Guide

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Purpose**: Explain build system orchestration patterns
**Organization**: spec-guide
**Scope**: cross-platform-build-system

---

## Related Guides

- [Token Selection Guide](./token-selection-guide.md) - Explains token resolution priority used by build orchestrator
- [Platform Generation Guide](./platform-generation-guide.md) - Explains platform-specific generation coordinated by orchestrator
- [Error Handling Guide](./error-handling-guide.md) - Explains error recovery strategies in build process

---

## Build Orchestration Architecture

[Guide content...]
```

#### Pattern 2: Completion-to-Guide (Created Artifacts)

**Use Case**: Link from task completion documents to the documentation guides they created, providing traceability from implementation to documentation and enabling readers to navigate from completion docs to the guides that explain the work.

**When to Use**:
- Completion documents that created new documentation guides
- Completion documents that updated existing guides
- Linking to guides that explain the architectural decisions made during the task
- Providing navigation from implementation notes to conceptual documentation

**Markdown Syntax**:
```markdown
# Task 2.3 Completion: Create Typography Guides

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Task**: 2.3 Create typography documentation guides
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

#### Pattern 3: Overview-to-Guide (Documentation Navigation)

**Use Case**: Link from overview documents (like Token System Overview, README files, or system catalogs) to detailed documentation guides, providing a navigation hub that helps readers discover relevant documentation for specific components or features.

**When to Use**:
- Overview documents that map system components to their documentation
- README files that provide navigation to detailed guides
- System catalogs that link to component-specific documentation
- Master documents that serve as documentation entry points

**Markdown Syntax**:

- **Mix of overview and detail**: Include both high-level and detailed documentation links
- **Relative paths**: Use appropriate relative paths from README location
- **Brief descriptions**: Help readers understand what each link provides

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

This section documents common anti-patterns in cross-reference usage and provides clear examples of what NOT to do, along with explanations of why these patterns are problematic.

#### Anti-Pattern 1: Cross-References in Production Code

**Problem**: Adding cross-references to documentation in production code files creates noise, maintenance burden, and distracts from implementation.

**Why This is Wrong**:
- Production code should be focused on implementation, not documentation navigation
- Code comments should be brief and implementation-focused
- Architectural rationale belongs in documentation guides, not code files
- Cross-references in code create maintenance burden when documentation moves
- Links in code comments don't provide value to developers reading the code

**Example - INCORRECT Usage**:

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Cross-references in production code
/**
 * Typography tokens for the design system.
 * 
 * Architecture Documentation:
 * - See .kiro/specs/typography-token-expansion/compositional-color-guide.md
 *   for explanation of why typography tokens don't include color
 * - See .kiro/specs/typography-token-expansion/strategic-flexibility-guide.md
 *   for explanation of size variant decisions
 * - See .kiro/specs/typography-token-expansion/inline-emphasis-guide.md
 *   for explanation of platform-native emphasis patterns
 * 
 * For migration guidance, see:
 * - .kiro/specs/typography-token-expansion/migration-guide.md
 */
export const TypographyTokens = {
  body: { 
    fontSize: 16, 
    lineHeight: 24, 
    fontFamily: 'system-ui',
    fontWeight: 400,
    letterSpacing: 0
  },
  label: {
    fontSize: 14,
    lineHeight: 20,
    fontFamily: 'system-ui',
    fontWeight: 500,
    letterSpacing: 0
  }
};
```

**Example - CORRECT Usage**:

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Brief, implementation-focused comment
/**
 * Typography tokens combining fontSize, lineHeight, fontFamily, fontWeight, and letterSpacing.
 * Tokens follow compositional architecture with semantic naming.
 */
export const TypographyTokens = {
  body: { 
    fontSize: 16, 
    lineHeight: 24, 
    fontFamily: 'system-ui',
    fontWeight: 400,
    letterSpacing: 0
  },
  label: {
    fontSize: 14,
    lineHeight: 20,
    fontFamily: 'system-ui',
    fontWeight: 500,
    letterSpacing: 0
  }
};
```

**Where Architectural Documentation Belongs**:

Instead of cross-references in code, create documentation guides that explain the architecture:

```markdown
# Typography Token Architecture Guide

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Purpose**: Explain typography token composition and design decisions
**Organization**: spec-guide
**Scope**: typography-token-expansion

## Typography Token Composition

Typography tokens combine multiple primitive tokens to create semantic typography styles.
Each token includes fontSize, lineHeight, fontFamily, fontWeight, and letterSpacing.

```

#### Anti-Pattern 2: Re-Explaining Concepts Without Cross-References

**Problem**: Duplicating architectural explanations across multiple documentation files instead of using cross-references creates maintenance burden and inconsistency.

**Why This is Wrong**:
- Duplicated explanations can become inconsistent when one is updated but others aren't
- Readers don't know which explanation is authoritative
- Maintenance burden increases with each duplication
- Wastes space in documents that should focus on their specific topic

**Example - INCORRECT Usage**:

```markdown
# Strategic Flexibility Guide

## Typography Token Size Variants

Typography tokens include size variants like labelXs, labelSm, labelMd, labelLg.

The compositional color architecture is a design pattern where typography tokens
don't include color properties. Instead, color is applied separately through
semantic color tokens. This allows the same typography token to be used with
different colors in different contexts. The architecture separates concerns
between typography (size, weight, spacing) and color (semantic meaning, theme).

This compositional approach provides flexibility because...

## Typography Token Size Variants

Typography tokens include size variants like labelXs, labelSm, labelMd, labelLg.
These variants follow the compositional architecture (see Compositional Color Guide)
where properties are separated by concern.

[Focus on size variant decisions without re-explaining compositional architecture]
```

#### Anti-Pattern 3: Absolute Paths in Cross-References

**Problem**: Using absolute paths or repository-specific paths instead of relative paths breaks links when repository structure changes or when viewing documentation in different contexts.

**Why This is Wrong**:
- Absolute paths break when repository is cloned or moved
- Repository-specific paths (like GitHub URLs) don't work in local filesystem
- Relative paths work across all viewing contexts (GitHub, local, documentation sites)

**Example - INCORRECT Usage**:

```markdown

```

#### Anti-Pattern 4: Vague Link Text Without Context

**Problem**: Using generic link text like "click here" or "see this document" without explaining why the link is relevant makes it difficult for readers to decide whether to follow the link.

**Why This is Wrong**:
- Readers can't determine relevance without clicking
- Generic link text doesn't help with document scanning
- No context for why the related document matters
- Reduces navigation efficiency

**Example - INCORRECT Usage**:

```markdown
# Typography Token Guide

## Related Guides

- [Click here](./compositional-color-guide.md)
- [See this document](./strategic-flexibility-guide.md)
- [More information](./inline-emphasis-guide.md)

- [Migration Guide](./migration-guide.md) - Provides migration path for renamed tokens
```

#### Anti-Pattern 5: Cross-References as Content Replacement

**Problem**: Using cross-references as a substitute for explaining core concepts in the current document makes documents dependent on other documents and reduces standalone readability.

**Why This is Wrong**:
- Documents should be standalone readable
- Readers shouldn't need to follow multiple links to understand core concepts
- Cross-references should enhance navigation, not replace content
- Creates circular dependencies between documents

**Example - INCORRECT Usage**:

```markdown
# Typography Token Guide

## Typography Token Composition

Typography tokens combine multiple primitive tokens to create semantic typography styles.
Each token includes fontSize, lineHeight, fontFamily, fontWeight, and letterSpacing.

The compositional architecture separates concerns by property type, allowing tokens
to be combined flexibly. For example, typography tokens don't include color properties,
enabling the same typography token to be used with different semantic colors.

[Detailed explanation of composition...]

For more details on the compositional architecture and its rationale, see the
Compositional Color Guide.

## Size Variants

Typography tokens include size variants like labelXs, labelSm, labelMd, labelLg.
These variants provide flexibility for different use cases while maintaining
consistent typography patterns.

### Cross-Reference Maintenance

#### After File Moves

When files are moved during organization:

1. Update all cross-reference links to reflect new locations
2. Verify bidirectional links remain consistent
3. Test navigation by clicking links in rendered markdown
4. Document any broken links and fix them immediately

#### Link Validation

Periodically validate cross-reference integrity:

- Verify all links resolve to existing documents
- Check that relative paths are correct from document location
- Confirm section anchors exist in target documents
- Test navigation efficiency (related docs reachable in 2 clicks or less)

#### Navigation as Aid, Not Dependency

Cross-references should be navigation aids, not content dependencies:

- Documents should remain standalone readable
- Cross-references help discover related information
- Don't rely on cross-references to explain core concepts
- Use cross-references to connect related concepts, not replace explanations

---

## Quality Standards

### Metadata Validation
- All new files must include organization metadata
- Organization values must match approved list
- Scope must be specific and meaningful
- Purpose must clearly describe file intent

### Cross-Reference Integrity
- All cross-references must be updated after file moves
- Bidirectional links must remain consistent
- Navigation efficiency must be maintained
- Link validation should be performed after organization

### Directory Structure Consistency
- Files must be placed in directories matching their organization metadata
- Directory structure must remain clean and navigable
- Related files must be grouped appropriately
- Temporary files must not accumulate in permanent directories

---

## Organization Decision Guidelines

### Framework-Strategic Criteria
- **Reusable across specs**: Will this be referenced by multiple future specs?
- **Strategic guidance**: Does this provide high-level direction or system architecture?
- **Cross-spec value**: Would other development efforts benefit from this?
- **Architectural knowledge**: Does this capture reusable architectural thinking?

### Spec-Validation Criteria
- **Validation specific**: Does this validate work specific to one spec?
- **Quality assurance**: Is this a quality check or verification report?
- **Spec-bounded**: Is the validation scope limited to one program of work?
- **Implementation verification**: Does this verify spec-specific implementation?

### Spec-Completion Criteria
- **Task completion**: Is this documentation of completed work?
- **Lessons learned**: Does this capture insights from specific implementation?
- **Completion artifacts**: Is this required for task or spec completion?
- **Implementation notes**: Does this document specific implementation decisions?

### Spec-Summary Criteria
- **Parent task summary**: Is this a concise summary of parent task completion?
- **Hook trigger**: Does this need to trigger automatic release detection?
- **Public-facing**: Is this intended as release note content?
- **Commit-style format**: Does this follow concise, what/why/impact format?
