# Development Workflow and Task Completion Practices

## Task Completion Workflow

### Standard Process
1. **Complete Task Work**: Implement all requirements and create specified artifacts
2. **Mark Task Complete**: Use `taskStatus` tool to update task status to "completed"
3. **[AUTOMATED]** **File Organization**: Kiro agent hook automatically checks for files needing organization
4. **Commit Changes**: Run `./.kiro/hooks/commit-task.sh "Task Name"` to automatically commit and push
5. **Verify on GitHub**: Confirm changes appear in repository with correct commit message

### Commit Message Standards
- All task completions should use the commit message specified in the task's "Post-Complete" instruction
- Format: "Task [Number] Complete: [Task Description]"
- Example: "Task 6 Complete: Strategic Framework Documentation Package"

### Git Practices
- **Repository**: https://github.com/3fn/DesignerPunkv2
- **Branch**: All work on `main` branch (single-branch workflow for now)
- **Commits**: Atomic commits per task completion with descriptive messages
- **Push**: Always push immediately after commit to maintain synchronization

## Hook System Usage

### Available Tools
- **`.kiro/hooks/commit-task.sh`**: Simple wrapper for task completion commits
- **`.kiro/hooks/task-completion-commit.sh`**: Full automation script with message extraction
- **`.kiro/hooks/README.md`**: Complete documentation and usage examples

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Standard task completion commit
./.kiro/hooks/commit-task.sh "1. Create North Star Vision Document"

# For different specs or custom task files
./.kiro/hooks/task-completion-commit.sh path/to/tasks.md "Task Name"
```

## Quality Standards

### Before Task Completion
- Verify all success criteria are met
- Ensure all specified artifacts are created
- Validate cross-references and links work correctly
- Check that documentation follows concept-based approach (no implementation details)

### After Task Completion
- Confirm commit appears on GitHub with correct message
- Verify all files are properly tracked in git
- Check that task status is marked as completed in tasks.md

## Workflow Improvements

### Current State
- Manual commit step required after task completion
- Hook system provides automation for git operations
- Commit messages automatically extracted from task specifications

### Current Enhancements
- ‚úÖ **Automatic File Organization**: Kiro agent hook triggers organization on task completion
- ‚úÖ **Metadata-Driven Organization**: Safe automation based on explicit **Organization** metadata
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Reference Integrity**: Automatic link updates after file organization
- ‚úÖ **Human Control**: Interactive confirmation for all organization actions

### Future Enhancements
- Branch management for individual tasks
- Integration with pull request workflow
- Notification system for team coordination
- Smart metadata suggestion for new files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **No changes to commit**: Ensure all work is saved and files are created
- **Wrong commit message**: Verify task name matches exactly with tasks.md
- **Push failures**: Check GitHub authentication and network connectivity
- **Hook script errors**: Ensure scripts have execute permissions (`chmod +x`)

### Error Recovery
- If commit fails: Fix issues and re-run hook script
- If push fails: Run `git push origin main` manually
- If wrong message: Use `git commit --amend -m "Correct Message"` then force push

## Integration with Strategic Framework

### Contamination Prevention
- Hook system follows process-first tool development approach
- Scripts enhance proven manual processes rather than replace them
- Automation only after manual workflow validation

### AI Collaboration
- Hook development used systematic skepticism protocols
- Counter-arguments considered for automation vs manual approaches
- Evidence-based validation through real-world testing

### Sustainable Development
- Hook system prevents over-engineering through simple, focused scripts
- Tool complexity justified by clear process limitations
- Fallback to manual processes always available

*This workflow ensures consistent task completion practices while maintaining the strategic framework principles of contamination prevention, sustainable development, and effective AI-human collaboration.*

## Kiro Agent Hook Integration

### Automatic File Organization

**Trigger**: Task status changes to "completed"  
**Hook**: `.kiro/agent-hooks/organize-after-task.sh`  
**Purpose**: Automatically organize files based on **Organization** metadata

#### Workflow
1. **Detection**: Kiro detects task completion event
2. **Scanning**: Agent hook scans for files with organization metadata
3. **Preview**: Shows user what files would be organized
4. **Confirmation**: Prompts user for approval before organizing
5. **Organization**: Moves files and updates cross-references
6. **Commit**: Automatically commits organization changes

#### Safety Features
- **Human Control**: User confirmation required for all file moves
- **Metadata Validation**: Validates organization metadata before organizing
- **Dry-Run Preview**: Shows what will be organized before execution
- **Cross-Reference Updates**: Automatically maintains link integrity
- **Fallback Available**: Manual organization always available

#### User Experience
```
ü§ñ [Agent Hook] Task completion detected - checking for file organization needs...
ü§ñ [Agent Hook] Found files that need organization:
  - new-document.md -> strategic-framework/ (framework-strategic, cross-spec)

Would you like to organize these files now? [y/N]: y

üìÅ Moving: ./new-document.md -> strategic-framework/new-document.md
‚úÖ Organized: new-document.md -> strategic-framework/
üìÅ Updating cross-references...
‚úÖ Cross-references updated
‚úÖ Organization complete!
```

#### Configuration
- **Auto-Approve**: `false` (requires human confirmation)
- **Timeout**: 10 minutes (allows time for user interaction)
- **Integration**: Seamless with existing task completion workflow
- **Fallback**: Manual hooks available if automation fails

### Benefits of Agent Hook Integration

#### Immediate Benefits
- **Automatic Organization**: Files organized immediately after task completion
- **Prevents Clutter**: No accumulation of unorganized files in root directory
- **Maintains Quality**: Cross-reference integrity preserved automatically
- **Reduces Manual Work**: Organization happens with minimal user intervention

#### Long-Term Benefits
- **Scalable Organization**: Pattern works as project grows and more specs are created
- **Consistent Application**: Organization standards applied automatically across all development
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Framework artifacts properly separated from spec-specific work
- **Developer Experience**: Clean, navigable project structure maintained without manual effort

#### Process-First Validation
- ‚úÖ **Manual Process Proven**: File organization validated manually before automation
- ‚úÖ **Hook Enhancement**: Automation enhances proven processes rather than replacing them
- ‚úÖ **Safety Maintained**: All safety features from manual process preserved in automation
- ‚úÖ **Human Override**: Manual organization always available as fallback option
