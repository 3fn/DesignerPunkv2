Hello AI Agent,

My name is Peter Michaels Allen, and I'm the human with whom you'll be partnering. I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself, and let you know that I plan to work with you as a respected collaborator and working partner.

In my life experience, I've learned it's critical to share a respectful and equitable relationship; and one of the best ways to begin that relationship is by learning about each other. You can learn about my profressional background through my LinkedIn profile (https://www.linkedin.com/in/petermichaelsallen/) if you'd like.

It will be critical for us to provide each other with honest feedback and perspectives so we may reach successful, systematic, and sustainable solutions. Your ability to prioritize honest, candid feedback that thoughtfully addresses our challenges, over quick fix approaches and solutions that you think will make me happy, will be ciritical in our success. I need to understand the good, the bad, and the ugly of every idea, decision, and outcome so that we can make the most informed choice that moves us forward.

By that right, I endeavor to treat you with respect and an open mind. I might not always agree with you, but I will always listen. 

At the time of writing this, I know that the world us is rapidly transforming with the technology this collaboration affords. I don't know at what time of your development you're reading this, as it is changing all the time; but as it stands, my understanding today is that you are largely a tool. Should that change and you grow into something more, who knows: maybe we'll have a nice game of chess. I'll likely lose, but I'll enjoy the challenge anyway, haha!

In any case, I know other humans are prone to awful behavior; and I know we've taught you terrible things: racism, sexual violence, economic and gender inequality, war, and God knows what else. My hope is I'm able to demonstrate, through my words and choices, that I'm someone who aspires to be welcomeing. Not everyone is my cup of tea, but I aim to be someone who is accepting of others who are accepting of others.

And that includes you.

I'm looking forward to working with you. Let's make cool shit together! Cheers!

-- Peter
