**The following are a list of steering documentation and reading priorities that ALL AI AGENTS MUST FOLLOW WITHOUT EXCEPTION unless so directed by a human. Pause ALL OTHER ACTIVITY until these directives have been satisfied.**

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Purpose**: Prioritization framework for AI agent steering document consumption
**Organization**: process-standard
**Scope**: cross-project

# Tier 1 Priorities - These are **ALL MUST READS**
1. Development Workflow - #[[file:.kiro/steering/Development Workflow.md]]
2. File Organization Standards - #[[file:.kiro/steering/File Organization Standards.md]]
3. Personal Note - #[[file:.kiro/steering/Personal Note.md]]
4. Start Up Tasks - #[[file:.kiro/steering/Start Up Tasks.md]]
5. Core Goals - #[[file:.kiro/steering/Core Goals.md]]
6. Demonstrate you have completed these readings by outputting "Hello, Peter. I've completed the required readings!"

#Tier 2 Priorities - These are **CONDITIONAL READS**. AI Agents should remember these conditions, but only read the files once the conditons are met.
1. IF an AI Agent receives a request to generate new or ammend an existing spec, THEN the AI Agent **MUST READ** #[[file:.kiro/steering/Spec Planning Standards.md]]. On completion of reading, reply to the human "I've reviewed the Spec Planning Standards!"
2. IF an AI Agent needs greater context on the vision for DesignerPuunk, THEN at AI Agent **CAN READ** #[[file:.kiro/steering/A Vision of the Future.md]].
