# Task 9 Completion: CHECKPOINT 3 - Present Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2026-01-03
**Task**: 9. CHECKPOINT 3: Present Implementation Plan
**Type**: Documentation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Summary

Checkpoint 3 presented the complete implementation plan to the human collaborator for review and approval. The plan was approved, and Phase 4 execution tasks have been defined in tasks.md.

## What Was Presented

### 1. Execution Task List Summary
- **18 batches** (0-17) with **107 total tasks**
- Organized into 7 phases (A-G)
- Clear dependencies between batches
- Risk levels assigned to each batch

### 2. Batch Execution Plan
- **Phase A**: Prerequisites (Batch 0 - Rosetta Analysis)
- **Phase B**: Foundation (Batches 1-7 - Consolidation)
- **Phase C**: Legacy Naming (Batches 8-9)
- **Phase D**: Low-Risk Renames (Batches 10-12)
- **Phase E**: Medium-Risk Renames (Batches 13-14)
- **Phase F**: High-Risk Renames (Batch 15)
- **Phase G**: Finalization (Batches 16-17)

### 3. Rollback Strategy
- Git-based version control as primary mechanism
- Backup branches for high-risk batches (2, 3, 15, 16)
- MCP re-index procedure after any rollback
- Emergency rollback procedure documented

### 4. Validation Criteria
- Per-batch validation checklist
- MCP health checks after every batch
- Cross-reference validation procedures
- Final validation criteria (Batch 17)

## Human Decision

**Approval**: The human collaborator approved the implementation plan and authorized proceeding to execution.

- Task 16: Batch 7 - Start Up Tasks Update
- Task 17: Batches 8-9 - Legacy Naming Fixes
- Task 18: Batches 10-12 - Low-Risk Prefix Renames
- Task 19: Batches 13-14 - Medium-Risk Prefix Renames
- Task 20: Batch 15 - High-Risk Prefix Renames (Process-)
- Task 21: Batch 16 - Meta-Guide Updates
- Task 22: Batch 17 - Final Validation

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Batches | 18 |
| Total Tasks | 107 |
| Documents to Create | 2-3 |
| Documents to Rename | 43 |
| Legacy Instances to Fix | 39 |
| Estimated Token Savings | ~11,000 tokens |
| Estimated Timeline | 10-15 sessions |

## Artifacts Referenced

- `audit-artifacts/execution-task-list.md` - Detailed task breakdown
- `audit-artifacts/batch-execution-plan.md` - Batch organization and dependencies
- `audit-artifacts/rollback-strategy.md` - Git-based rollback procedures
- `audit-artifacts/validation-criteria.md` - Success criteria per batch

## Next Steps

1. Begin Task 10: Batch 0 - Rosetta System Content Analysis
2. Analyze 14 token docs to finalize infrastructure vs family classification
3. Proceed through execution batches in dependency order
