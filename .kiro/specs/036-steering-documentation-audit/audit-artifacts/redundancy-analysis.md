## Harmful Redundancy (Consolidation Candidates)

| Content Topic | Documents | Proposed Canonical Source |
|---------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| [TBD]         | [TBD]     | [TBD]                     |

## Intentional Priming (Acceptable)

| Content Topic | Priming Location | Canonical Source | Priming Length |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| [TBD]         | [TBD]            | [TBD]            | [TBD]          |

## Cross-Reference Analysis

[To be populated during Task 3.1 using MCP `list_cross_references()`]

---

## Redundancy Classification Criteria

### Harmful Redundancy
- Detailed content duplicated across multiple documents
- Creates maintenance burden (updates needed in multiple places)
- Risk of inconsistency between copies
- **Action**: Consolidate to single canonical source

### Intentional Priming
- Light context that orients before directing to canonical source
- Purpose-based: explains *what* and *why* to query, not *how*
- ~3-4 sentences max before MCP query direction
- **Action**: Keep as acceptable priming

---

## Recommendations

[To be populated during Task 3.2 - pending Checkpoint 2 approval]

---

## Notes

- Redundancy analysis will be populated during Tasks 3.1-3.2
- Classification follows priming guidelines from Requirements 3.3-3.4
- Consolidation recommendations require human approval at Checkpoint 2
