- GAP-010 (CLOSE) documented consistently

**User Need IDs Consistent Across Documents**:
- UN-001 through UN-010 referenced consistently
- UN-009 marked as complete in all documents
- 9 valid needs mapped to 9 gaps correctly

**Pattern IDs Consistent Across Documents**:
- GP-001 through GP-005 (Generator Patterns)
- TP-001 through TP-005 (Token Output Patterns)
- CP-001 through CP-007 (Component Consumption Patterns)
- DP-001 through DP-003 (Documentation Patterns)
- CMP-001, CMP-002 (Composition Patterns)

**Catalog IDs Consistent Across Documents**:
- NC-001 through NC-021 referenced consistently
- Lineage categories match across documents

### 5. Spec 031 Design-Outline Consistency

**Verified alignment between**:
- `implementation-recommendations.md` phased approach
- `031-blend-infrastructure-implementation/design-outline.md` scope and phases

**Consistent Elements**:
- Phase 1: Build Integration (2-3 days)
