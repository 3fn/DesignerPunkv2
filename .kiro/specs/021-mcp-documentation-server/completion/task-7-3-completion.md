# Task 7.3 Completion: Update Meta-Guide with MCP Usage

## Task Summary
**Task**: Update meta-guide with MCP usage documentation
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Completed**: 2025-01-13

## What Was Done

### 1. Updated Steering Documentation
Added comprehensive MCP server usage documentation to `.kiro/steering/00-Steering Documentation Directional Priorities.md`:

#### New Sections Added:
- **Documentation Access via MCP Server** - Overview and rationale
- **Why Use the MCP Server?** - Benefits (82% token reduction, progressive disclosure, context budget management)
- **Available MCP Tools** - Table of all 9 tools with purposes and token costs
- **Progressive Disclosure Workflow** - Step-by-step pattern for documentation queries
- **Query Examples by Task Type** - Concrete examples for implementation, debugging, code review, and planning tasks
- **Best Practices** - 6 key practices for efficient MCP usage
- **Maintenance Tools** - Documentation of health and maintenance tools
- **When NOT to Use MCP Server** - Clear guidance on limitations
