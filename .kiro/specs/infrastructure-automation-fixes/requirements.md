# Requirements Document: Infrastructure Automation Fixes

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Spec**: infrastructure-automation-fixes
**Status**: Requirements Phase
**Dependencies**: release-detection-infrastructure-investigation

---

## Introduction

This specification implements fixes for infrastructure automation failures identified in the Release Detection Infrastructure Investigation (completed October 29, 2025). The investigation identified 10 specific fixes across 7 issues, organized into three priority tiers.

**Investigation Reference**: `.kiro/specs/release-detection-infrastructure-investigation/root-cause-analysis.md`

**Primary Root Cause**: Script bug in `.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh` (line 117) where incorrect npm command syntax causes indefinite stall, preventing hook completion and causing 5-minute timeout.

**Secondary Root Cause**: Kiro IDE provides no logging for agent hook execution, making it impossible to verify event emission, hook triggering, or execution flow.

**Fix Organization**:
- **Priority 1 (CRITICAL)**: Release detection automation fixes - 4 fixes
- **Priority 2 (IMPORTANT)**: File organization reliability fixes - 2 fixes  
- **Priority 3 (MINOR)**: Documentation and usability fixes - 4 fixes

This specification implements all fixes that can be completed without Kiro IDE team involvement. Long-term improvements requiring IDE changes (Kiro IDE logging, runAfter failure handling) are documented for future feature requests.

## Glossary

- **Issue #001**: Release detection hook not triggering (CRITICAL)
- **Issue #003**: Agent hook triggering cannot be verified (IMPORTANT)
- **Issue #004**: Release manager hook dependency chain unclear (MINOR)
- **Issue #002**: commit-task.sh treats --help as task name (IMPORTANT)
- **Issue #006**: Cross-reference update logic has path issues (IMPORTANT)
- **Issue #007**: File organization only scans root directory (MINOR)
- **Release Manager Script**: `.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh` - processes release triggers
- **File Organization Script**: `.kiro/agent-hooks/organize-after-task.sh` - organizes files by metadata
- **Agent Hook System**: Kiro IDE's event-driven automation responding to taskStatusChange events
- **runAfter Dependency**: Hook configuration specifying execution order (e.g., release detection runs after file organization)
- **Entry Logging**: Logging at script start to confirm hook was triggered by IDE

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix npm Syntax Bug in release-manager.sh (Issue #001 - Fix 1)

**Investigation Finding**: Line 117 of `.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh` contains incorrect npm command syntax that causes indefinite stall. Current code: `npm run release:detect process-triggers`. npm requires `--` separator to pass arguments to scripts.

**Fix Specification**: Change line 117 to use correct npm argument syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN line 117 is modified THEN the command SHALL be `npm run release:detect -- process-triggers`
2. WHEN the release-manager.sh script executes THEN the script SHALL complete without stalling at npm command
3. WHEN the npm command runs THEN arguments SHALL be passed correctly to the release:detect script
4. WHEN test-manual-release-detection.sh is executed THEN the script SHALL verify completion without timeout
5. WHEN release detection runs automatically THEN the hook SHALL complete within 5-minute timeout

---

### Requirement 2: Improve Error Visibility in release-manager.sh (Issue #001 - Fix 2)

**Investigation Finding**: Line 117 redirects npm output to `/dev/null` with `>/dev/null 2>&1`, hiding all error messages. This made debugging the npm syntax bug extremely difficult.

**Fix Specification**: Redirect npm output to log file instead of /dev/null to make errors visible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN line 117 is modified THEN npm output SHALL be redirected to `$LOG_FILE` using `>> "$LOG_FILE" 2>&1`
2. WHEN npm command encounters errors THEN error messages SHALL appear in `.kiro/logs/release-manager.log`
3. WHEN npm command succeeds THEN success output SHALL appear in log file
4. WHEN debugging script issues THEN developers SHALL be able to see npm command output in log
5. WHEN log file grows THEN append mode SHALL prevent overwriting previous entries

---

### Requirement 3: Add Entry Logging to release-manager.sh (Issue #001 - Fix 3)

**Investigation Finding**: No logging at script start makes it impossible to verify if hook was triggered by Kiro IDE. Cannot distinguish "hook not triggering" from "hook triggering but failing".

**Fix Specification**: Add entry point logging at start of release-manager.sh to confirm hook triggering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN release-manager.sh starts execution THEN the script SHALL log "Hook triggered by Kiro IDE agent hook system"
2. WHEN entry logging executes THEN the log SHALL include event type "taskStatusChange" and status "completed"
3. WHEN entry logging executes THEN the log SHALL include timestamp in format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
4. WHEN reviewing logs THEN developers SHALL be able to verify hook was triggered by checking for entry message
5. WHEN hook fails THEN entry message SHALL help distinguish triggering from execution failure

---

### Requirement 4: Add Entry Logging to organize-after-task.sh (Issue #003 - Fix 1)

**Investigation Finding**: File organization hook also lacks entry logging, making it impossible to verify if it triggers before release detection hook (runAfter dependency).

**Fix Specification**: Add entry point logging at start of organize-after-task.sh to confirm hook triggering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organize-after-task.sh starts execution THEN the script SHALL log "Hook triggered by Kiro IDE agent hook system"
2. WHEN entry logging executes THEN the log SHALL include event type "taskStatusChange" and status "completed"
3. WHEN entry logging executes THEN the log SHALL include timestamp in format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
4. WHEN reviewing logs THEN developers SHALL be able to verify file organization triggered before release detection
5. WHEN debugging runAfter dependencies THEN entry logs SHALL show execution order

---

### Requirement 5: Fix Cross-Reference Update Logic in organize-by-metadata.sh (Issue #006)

**Investigation Finding**: Cross-reference update logic in organize-by-metadata.sh has reliability concerns with relative path handling and Python dependency. Script uses Python for cross-reference updates which may not be available in all environments.

**Fix Specification**: Improve cross-reference update logic to handle paths correctly and provide clear error messages for missing dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are moved THEN cross-reference update logic SHALL correctly calculate relative paths from new locations
2. WHEN Python is not available THEN the script SHALL provide clear error message indicating Python dependency
3. WHEN cross-references are updated THEN links SHALL remain valid after file organization
4. WHEN cross-reference update fails THEN the script SHALL log specific error with file paths involved
5. WHEN testing with test-file-organization.sh THEN cross-reference updates SHALL be verified

---

### Requirement 6: Document File Organization Scope Limitation (Issue #007)

**Investigation Finding**: File organization script only scans root directory, not subdirectories. Investigation revealed this is intentional design (completion documents are in subdirectories, organization scans root for new files). However, this design decision is not documented.

**Fix Specification**: Document the intentional scope limitation and provide guidance for manual organization of subdirectory files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers read Development Workflow documentation THEN the documentation SHALL explain file organization scans root directory only
2. WHEN developers encounter files in subdirectories THEN documentation SHALL explain these are not automatically organized
3. WHEN developers need to organize subdirectory files THEN documentation SHALL provide manual organization guidance
4. WHEN developers question the scope limitation THEN documentation SHALL explain the rationale (completion docs in subdirectories, new files in root)
5. WHEN file organization runs THEN behavior SHALL match documented scope

---

### Requirement 7: Document runAfter Dependency Behavior (Issue #004 - Fix 1)

**Investigation Finding**: The `runAfter` configuration in release detection hook specifies dependency on file organization, but there is no documentation explaining what runAfter means, how it behaves when dependencies fail, timeout, or are skipped by user.

**Fix Specification**: Create comprehensive documentation of runAfter semantics in Development Workflow documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers read Development Workflow documentation THEN the documentation SHALL explain runAfter specifies execution order
2. WHEN prerequisite hook fails THEN documentation SHALL explain whether dependent hook runs or skips
3. WHEN prerequisite hook times out THEN documentation SHALL explain whether dependent hook runs or skips
4. WHEN user declines prerequisite hook confirmation THEN documentation SHALL explain whether dependent hook runs or skips
5. WHEN developers design hook chains THEN documentation SHALL provide guidance on reliable dependency patterns

---

### Requirement 8: Fix commit-task.sh --help Handling (Issue #002)

**Investigation Finding**: commit-task.sh treats `--help` as a task name instead of displaying help information. Script lacks argument parsing for help flags.

**Fix Specification**: Add help flag handling to commit-task.sh before task name processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commit-task.sh is invoked with `--help` flag THEN the script SHALL display usage information and exit
2. WHEN commit-task.sh is invoked with `-h` flag THEN the script SHALL display usage information and exit
3. WHEN commit-task.sh is invoked without arguments THEN the script SHALL display usage information and exit
4. WHEN help information is displayed THEN it SHALL include script purpose, usage syntax, and examples
5. WHEN commit-task.sh is invoked with a task name THEN the script SHALL process the task name correctly (existing behavior preserved)

---

### Requirement 9: Validate Fixes with Test Scripts

**Investigation Finding**: Investigation created 3 test scripts that validate specific behaviors and can be reused for fix validation.

**Fix Specification**: Use existing test scripts to validate that fixes work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN release detection fixes are implemented THEN test-manual-release-detection.sh SHALL verify script completes without stalling
2. WHEN hook configurations are modified THEN test-hook-configuration.sh SHALL verify configuration correctness
3. WHEN entry logging is added THEN test-event-emission.sh SHALL detect evidence of hook triggering
4. WHEN file organization fixes are implemented THEN test-file-organization.sh SHALL verify cross-reference updates
5. WHEN all Priority 1 fixes are complete THEN release detection automation SHALL work end-to-end without manual intervention

---

### Requirement 10: Document Long-Term IDE Improvements (Issue #001 - Fix 4, Issue #003 - Fix 2, Issue #004 - Fix 2)

**Investigation Finding**: Three fixes require Kiro IDE team involvement and cannot be implemented in this spec:
- Issue #001 Fix 4: Kiro IDE logging for agent hook execution
- Issue #003 Fix 2: Kiro IDE logging feature with comprehensive event/hook/execution logging
- Issue #004 Fix 2: Explicit failure handling configuration (continueOnFailure, continueOnSkip, continueOnTimeout)

**Fix Specification**: Document these long-term improvements with detailed requirements for future IDE feature requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting IDE logging requirements THEN documentation SHALL specify event emission logging, hook triggering logging, hook execution logging, and dependency chain logging
2. WHEN documenting runAfter failure handling THEN documentation SHALL specify configuration options for continueOnFailure, continueOnSkip, and continueOnTimeout
3. WHEN documenting IDE features THEN documentation SHALL include rationale, use cases, expected benefits, and priority assessment
4. WHEN Kiro IDE team reviews requests THEN documentation SHALL provide sufficient detail for implementation planning
5. WHEN IDE features are implemented THEN documentation SHALL provide integration guidance for adopting new capabilities
