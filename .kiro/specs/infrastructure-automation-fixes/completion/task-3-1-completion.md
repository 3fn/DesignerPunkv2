# Task 3.1 Completion: Document runAfter Dependency Behavior

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Task**: 3.1 Document runAfter dependency behavior
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/steering/Development Workflow.md` - Added "Agent Hook Execution Order" section

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Added comprehensive documentation about runAfter dependency behavior to the Development Workflow document. The new section is positioned within the "Kiro Agent Hook Integration" section, before the "Automatic File Organization" subsection, to provide context for understanding the hook chain.

The documentation covers:
1. **runAfter Dependencies**: Explains the current hook chain (file organization → release detection)
2. **Dependency Behavior**: Documents how hooks behave in different scenarios (success, failure, timeout, cancellation)
3. **Current Hook Chain**: Visual diagram showing the complete execution flow
4. **Troubleshooting Hook Chains**: Step-by-step guidance for verifying hook execution
5. **Common Hook Chain Issues**: Specific problems and solutions
6. **Best Practices**: Recommendations for working with hook chains

### Key Decisions

**Decision 1**: Acknowledge IDE Implementation Uncertainty
- **Rationale**: The investigation revealed that Kiro IDE behavior for prerequisite failures and user cancellations is currently unclear
- **Approach**: Documented this uncertainty explicitly rather than making assumptions
- **Benefit**: Sets accurate expectations and encourages testing to determine actual behavior

**Decision 2**: Include Visual Hook Chain Diagram
- **Rationale**: Visual representation helps developers understand the execution flow
- **Approach**: Used ASCII diagram showing event → file organization → release detection
- **Benefit**: Makes the dependency relationship immediately clear

**Decision 3**: Comprehensive Troubleshooting Section
- **Rationale**: Investigation showed that lack of visibility into hook execution was a major pain point
- **Approach**: Provided step-by-step troubleshooting with specific log locations and commands
- **Benefit**: Developers can diagnose hook chain issues independently

### Integration Points

The new section integrates with existing documentation:
- **Automatic File Organization**: Provides context for why file organization runs first
- **Automatic Release Detection**: Explains the runAfter dependency that makes release detection wait
- **Troubleshooting**: Complements existing troubleshooting guidance with hook-chain-specific issues

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ Markdown formatting correct
✅ Code blocks properly formatted

### Functional Validation
✅ Documentation explains runAfter specifies execution order
✅ Dependency behavior documented (success, failure, timeout, cancellation)
✅ Troubleshooting guidance provided with specific steps
✅ Hook chain diagram shows complete execution flow
✅ Common issues documented with solutions

### Integration Validation
✅ Section positioned logically within Kiro Agent Hook Integration
✅ References existing sections (file organization, release detection)
✅ Complements existing troubleshooting guidance
✅ Consistent with documentation style and formatting

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 7.1: Documentation explains runAfter specifies execution order
✅ Requirement 7.2: Documented behavior when prerequisite fails (currently unclear, noted)
✅ Requirement 7.3: Documented behavior when prerequisite times out (independent timeouts)
✅ Requirement 7.4: Documented behavior when user declines prerequisite (currently unclear, noted)
✅ Requirement 7.5: Provided troubleshooting guidance for hook chains

## Documentation Quality

### Clarity
- Visual hook chain diagram makes execution flow immediately clear
- Step-by-step troubleshooting guidance is actionable
- Common issues section addresses specific problems developers encounter
- Best practices provide clear recommendations

### Accuracy
- Acknowledges uncertainty about IDE behavior rather than making assumptions
- Documents actual hook configurations and timeouts
- References correct log file locations and commands
- Consistent with investigation findings

### Completeness
- Covers all aspects of runAfter dependency behavior
- Includes troubleshooting for all common scenarios
- Provides both diagnostic steps and solutions
- Addresses both automatic and manual triggering

### Usefulness
- Developers can diagnose hook chain issues independently
- Clear guidance for verifying hook execution
- Specific commands and log locations provided
- Best practices help prevent common issues
