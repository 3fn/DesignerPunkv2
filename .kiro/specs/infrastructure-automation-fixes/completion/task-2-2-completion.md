# Task 2.2 Completion: Document File Organization Scope Limitation

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Task**: 2.2 Document file organization scope limitation
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/steering/Development Workflow.md` - Added "File Organization Scope" section

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Added a comprehensive "File Organization Scope" section to the Development Workflow documentation that explains the intentional design decision to scan only the root directory for file organization. The section was placed immediately after the "Automatic File Organization" section to provide context about scope limitations right after explaining the automation feature.

The documentation follows a clear structure:
1. **Intentional Design Statement**: Clear upfront statement that root-only scanning is intentional
2. **Why Root Directory Only**: Explains the workflow pattern that informed this design
3. **Rationale**: Provides specific reasons for the scope limitation
4. **Manual Organization Guidance**: Offers three practical options for organizing subdirectory files
5. **Scope Behavior Summary**: Visual table summarizing behavior across different locations

### Key Decisions

**Decision 1**: Placement after Automatic File Organization section
- **Rationale**: Developers reading about automatic organization will immediately see the scope limitation, preventing confusion about why subdirectory files aren't being organized
- **Alternative**: Could have placed in a separate "Limitations" section, but that would separate related information

**Decision 2**: Three manual organization options
- **Rationale**: Provides flexibility for different workflows - temporary move to root (uses automation), fully manual (complete control), or direct script usage (middle ground)
- **Alternative**: Could have provided only one "recommended" approach, but different situations call for different methods

**Decision 3**: Visual table for scope behavior
- **Rationale**: Quick reference format makes it easy to understand what's automated vs manual at a glance
- **Alternative**: Could have used prose description, but table format is more scannable

### Integration Points

The documentation integrates with:
- **File Organization Standards**: References the organization metadata system
- **Automatic File Organization section**: Provides context for the scope limitation
- **Manual organization processes**: Explains fallback options when automation doesn't apply

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors in Development Workflow.md
✅ Markdown formatting correct
✅ Code blocks properly formatted

### Functional Validation
✅ Documentation explains intentional design (scans root directory only)
✅ Rationale provided (completion docs in subdirectories, new files in root)
✅ Manual organization guidance provided with three practical options
✅ Scope behavior clearly summarized in table format
✅ Integration with existing documentation sections maintained

### Integration Validation
✅ Section placed logically after Automatic File Organization
✅ References to organization metadata system consistent with File Organization Standards
✅ Manual organization options align with existing hook scripts
✅ Documentation style consistent with rest of Development Workflow document

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 6.1: Documentation explains file organization scans root directory only
✅ Requirement 6.2: Documentation explains files in subdirectories are not automatically organized
✅ Requirement 6.3: Manual organization guidance provided with three options
✅ Requirement 6.4: Rationale explained (completion docs in subdirectories, new files in root)
✅ Requirement 6.5: Documentation is clear, complete, and follows established format

## Requirements Compliance

**Requirement 6.1**: WHEN developers read Development Workflow documentation THEN the documentation SHALL explain file organization scans root directory only
- ✅ Met: "File Organization Scope" section clearly states "scans **root directory only**, not subdirectories"

**Requirement 6.2**: WHEN developers encounter files in subdirectories THEN documentation SHALL explain these are not automatically organized
- ✅ Met: "Why Root Directory Only?" section explains subdirectories are intentionally excluded, with scope behavior table showing subdirectories are not automatically organized

**Requirement 6.3**: WHEN developers need to organize subdirectory files THEN documentation SHALL provide manual organization guidance
- ✅ Met: "Manual Organization for Subdirectory Files" section provides three practical options with step-by-step instructions

**Requirement 6.4**: WHEN developers question the scope limitation THEN documentation SHALL explain the rationale (completion docs in subdirectories, new files in root)
- ✅ Met: "Why Root Directory Only?" and "Rationale" sections explain the workflow pattern and design reasoning

**Requirement 6.5**: WHEN file organization runs THEN behavior SHALL match documented scope
- ✅ Met: Documentation accurately describes the current behavior of organize-by-metadata.sh and organize-after-task.sh scripts

## Implementation Notes

### Documentation Structure

The section follows a logical flow:
1. **Clear statement of limitation** - No ambiguity about scope
2. **Explanation of why** - Helps developers understand the design decision
3. **Practical guidance** - Provides actionable steps for edge cases
4. **Visual summary** - Quick reference for scope behavior

### Developer Experience Considerations

The documentation anticipates common questions:
- "Why doesn't it scan subdirectories?" → Explained in "Why Root Directory Only?"
- "What if I need to organize a subdirectory file?" → Three options provided
- "Is this a bug or intentional?" → Clearly stated as intentional design

### Consistency with Investigation Findings

The documentation aligns with the investigation findings from `.kiro/specs/release-detection-infrastructure-investigation/root-cause-analysis.md`:
- Confirms the intentional design decision
- Explains the workflow pattern that informed the design
- Provides practical guidance for edge cases
- Maintains consistency with File Organization Standards
