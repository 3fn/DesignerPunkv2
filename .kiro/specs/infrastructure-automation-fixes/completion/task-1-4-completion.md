# Task 1.4 Completion: Add Entry Logging to organize-after-task.sh

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Task**: 1.4 Add entry logging to organize-after-task.sh
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Modified

- `.kiro/agent-hooks/organize-after-task.sh` - Added entry logging function and call at script start
- `.kiro/logs/file-organization.log` - Created log file with entry messages

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Added entry logging functionality to the organize-after-task.sh script to enable verification of hook triggering. The implementation follows the same pattern used in release-manager.sh (Task 1.3) for consistency across the hook system.

The entry logging function is called immediately after the script starts (after shebang and set -e), ensuring that every execution is logged regardless of whether the hook completes successfully or encounters errors.

### Key Implementation Details

**Entry Logging Function**:
- Creates log directory if it doesn't exist (defensive programming)
- Logs entry message with timestamp in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
- Logs event type "taskStatusChange" and status "completed"
- Uses dedicated log file `.kiro/logs/file-organization.log` (separate from release-manager.log)

**Execution Flow**:
```bash
1. Script starts
2. Entry logging function defined
3. Entry logging function called immediately
4. Rest of script executes (organization logic)
```

**Log Format**:
```
[2025-10-29 16:51:08] Hook triggered by Kiro IDE agent hook system
[2025-10-29 16:51:08] Event: taskStatusChange, Status: completed
```

### Integration with Hook Chain

This entry logging enables verification of the hook chain dependency:
- File organization hook runs first (this script)
- Release detection hook runs after (via runAfter dependency)
- Entry logs in both files show execution order and timing

Developers can now verify:
- Whether file organization hook triggered
- When it triggered (timestamp)
- That it triggered before release detection (by comparing timestamps)

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ Bash script syntax correct
✅ All variables properly defined

### Functional Validation
✅ Entry logging function executes successfully
✅ Log file created at `.kiro/logs/file-organization.log`
✅ Entry message includes timestamp in correct format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
✅ Entry message includes event type "taskStatusChange" and status "completed"
✅ Log directory created automatically if it doesn't exist
✅ Script continues to execute normally after entry logging

### Integration Validation
✅ Entry logging doesn't interfere with existing script functionality
✅ Script still displays help correctly with --help flag
✅ Entry logging uses dedicated log file (separate from release-manager.log)
✅ Log format consistent with release-manager.sh entry logging
✅ Entry logging called at script start (before any other operations)

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 4.1: Entry logging function added at start of script (after shebang)
✅ Requirement 4.2: Logs "Hook triggered by Kiro IDE agent hook system" with timestamp
✅ Requirement 4.3: Logs event type "taskStatusChange" and status "completed"
✅ Requirement 4.4: Entry logging function called at script start
✅ Requirement 4.5: Uses dedicated log file `.kiro/logs/file-organization.log`

## Testing Results

**Test 1: Script Execution**
- Executed script with --help flag
- Entry log created successfully
- Script displayed help without errors

**Test 2: Log File Verification**
- Verified log file exists at `.kiro/logs/file-organization.log`
- Verified entry messages present with correct format
- Verified timestamp format is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
- Verified event type and status are logged

**Test 3: Log Directory Creation**
- Verified log directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist
- Defensive programming ensures no errors if directory is missing

## Benefits

### Debugging Capability
- Can now verify if file organization hook triggered
- Can distinguish "hook not triggering" from "hook triggering but failing"
- Can verify hook chain execution order (organization → release detection)

### Audit Trail
- Every hook execution is logged with timestamp
- Event type and status provide context for why hook triggered
- Separate log file prevents confusion with release detection logs

### Consistency
- Entry logging pattern consistent across both hooks
- Same log format and structure
- Same defensive programming (directory creation)

## Next Steps

This completes the entry logging implementation for organize-after-task.sh. The next task (1.5) will validate all Priority 1 fixes using the test scripts to ensure end-to-end automation works correctly.

*Entry logging successfully added to file organization hook, enabling verification of hook triggering and execution order in the hook chain.*
