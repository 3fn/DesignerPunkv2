# Task 3.2 Completion: Add Hook Troubleshooting Guidance

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Task**: 3.2 Add hook troubleshooting guidance
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Modified

- `.kiro/steering/Development Workflow.md` - Added comprehensive "Hook Troubleshooting" section

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Added a comprehensive "Hook Troubleshooting" section to the Development Workflow documentation that consolidates and expands on existing troubleshooting guidance. The section provides systematic diagnostic procedures, common issue resolutions, and actionable commands for developers to verify and debug agent hook execution.

The troubleshooting guidance is organized into clear subsections:
1. **Verifying Hook Execution** - Step-by-step diagnostic procedures
2. **Manual Trigger Commands** - How to trigger hooks manually for testing
3. **Common Issues and Solutions** - Five major issue categories with detailed solutions
4. **Best Practices for Hook Reliability** - Proactive guidance to prevent issues
5. **Quick Reference: Diagnostic Commands** - Copy-paste command reference

### Key Decisions

**Decision 1**: Comprehensive diagnostic procedures
- **Rationale**: Developers need systematic approaches to diagnose hook issues, not just error descriptions
- **Implementation**: Three-step verification process (entry logs → execution order → configurations)
- **Benefit**: Provides clear path from symptom to diagnosis to solution

**Decision 2**: Issue-focused organization
- **Rationale**: Developers typically start with a symptom and need to find the solution
- **Implementation**: Five common issue categories with symptoms, causes, and solutions
- **Benefit**: Enables quick problem identification and resolution

**Decision 3**: Actionable command examples
- **Rationale**: Developers need copy-paste commands, not just conceptual guidance
- **Implementation**: Bash code blocks throughout with specific commands
- **Benefit**: Reduces friction in troubleshooting process

**Decision 4**: Quick reference section
- **Rationale**: Experienced developers need fast access to diagnostic commands
- **Implementation**: Consolidated command reference at end of section
- **Benefit**: Supports both learning and quick reference use cases

### Integration Points

The Hook Troubleshooting section integrates with existing Development Workflow content:
- References entry logging added in tasks 1.3 and 1.4
- Builds on "Troubleshooting Hook Chains" subsection in Agent Hook Integration
- Complements "Agent Hook Execution Order" section from task 3.1
- Provides actionable guidance for issues described in other sections

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors in Development Workflow.md
✅ Markdown formatting correct throughout
✅ Code blocks properly formatted with bash syntax

### Functional Validation
✅ All diagnostic commands are valid and executable
✅ Entry log format matches actual log output from hooks
✅ Configuration file paths are correct
✅ Manual trigger commands reference actual hook scripts
✅ Issue symptoms match real-world hook failures

### Integration Validation
✅ References to log files match actual file locations (.kiro/logs/)
✅ Hook configuration paths match actual config files (.kiro/agent-hooks/)
✅ Manual trigger commands reference actual hook scripts (.kiro/hooks/)
✅ Integrates with existing troubleshooting content without duplication
✅ Cross-references to other sections are accurate

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 7.5: Troubleshooting guidance for hook chains provided
✅ Requirement 9.2: Hook configuration verification documented
✅ Requirement 9.3: Manual trigger commands documented

## Requirements Compliance

### Requirement 7.5: Troubleshooting Guidance for Hook Chains

**Requirement**: Document troubleshooting guidance for hook chains

**Implementation**:
- "Verifying Hook Execution" section provides step-by-step diagnostic procedures
- "Common Issues and Solutions" covers five major issue categories
- "Issue 4: Dependency Chain Broken" specifically addresses hook chain problems
- "Best Practices for Hook Reliability" includes guidance on understanding dependencies

**Evidence**: Hook Troubleshooting section includes comprehensive guidance for diagnosing and resolving hook chain issues, with specific focus on dependency chain problems.

### Requirement 9.2: Hook Configuration Verification

**Requirement**: Document how to check hook configurations

**Implementation**:
- "Step 3: Check Hook Configurations" provides specific commands to verify configurations
- Configuration checklist includes all critical configuration elements
- JSON validation commands provided for syntax checking
- Configuration file paths documented for both hooks

**Evidence**: Developers can verify hook configurations using provided commands and checklist.

### Requirement 9.3: Manual Trigger Commands

**Requirement**: Document manual trigger commands

**Implementation**:
- "Manual Trigger Commands" section provides commands for both hooks
- Explains when to use manual triggers
- Includes commands to check results after manual triggering
- "Quick Reference: Diagnostic Commands" consolidates all manual trigger commands

**Evidence**: Manual trigger commands documented with usage guidance and result verification.

## Content Structure

### Verifying Hook Execution (3 steps)
1. Check entry logs - Confirms hook triggering
2. Verify execution order - Confirms dependency chain
3. Check configurations - Confirms valid configuration

### Manual Trigger Commands
- File organization hook (workaround via organize-by-metadata.sh)
- Release detection hook (direct manual trigger)
- When to use manual triggers

### Common Issues and Solutions (5 issues)
1. No entry logs (hooks not triggering)
2. Entry logs present but no completion
3. Hook timeout
4. Dependency chain broken
5. Cross-reference updates fail

Each issue includes:
- Symptoms (what developers observe)
- Causes (why it happens)
- Solutions (how to fix it)

### Best Practices for Hook Reliability (6 practices)
1. Always use `taskStatus` tool
2. Monitor log files
3. Test independently
4. Understand dependencies
5. Maintain fallback procedures
6. Keep configurations valid

### Quick Reference: Diagnostic Commands
Consolidated bash commands for:
- Checking hook triggering
- Viewing log entries
- Validating configurations
- Checking permissions
- Manual triggers
- Verifying dependencies

## Documentation Quality

### Actionability
✅ Every diagnostic procedure includes specific commands
✅ All commands are copy-paste ready
✅ Solutions provide step-by-step instructions
✅ Quick reference enables fast troubleshooting

### Completeness
✅ Covers all major hook failure scenarios
✅ Addresses both automatic and manual triggering
✅ Includes dependency chain troubleshooting
✅ Provides both learning and reference content

### Clarity
✅ Clear section organization (symptoms → causes → solutions)
✅ Consistent formatting throughout
✅ Code blocks clearly labeled with bash syntax
✅ Expected outputs documented for diagnostic commands

### Integration
✅ References existing Development Workflow content
✅ Builds on entry logging from previous tasks
✅ Complements Agent Hook Integration section
✅ No duplication of existing content

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

**Issue-Focused Organization**: Organizing by common issues (rather than by hook type or component) makes it easier for developers to find solutions when they encounter problems.

**Actionable Commands**: Providing copy-paste bash commands throughout significantly reduces friction in the troubleshooting process.

**Layered Approach**: Combining systematic diagnostic procedures, issue-specific solutions, best practices, and quick reference supports both learning and experienced users.

### Challenges

**Balancing Detail and Brevity**: The section needed to be comprehensive enough to solve real problems while remaining scannable and not overwhelming. Solved by using clear subsections and consistent formatting.

**Avoiding Duplication**: Some troubleshooting content already existed in "Troubleshooting Hook Chains" subsection. Consolidated and expanded rather than duplicating.

### Future Considerations

**Visual Diagrams**: Could add flowchart diagrams for diagnostic procedures to make the troubleshooting process even clearer.

**Troubleshooting Examples**: Could add real-world troubleshooting scenarios with step-by-step walkthroughs.

**Hook Testing Guide**: Could create separate guide for testing hooks during development to prevent issues before they occur.
