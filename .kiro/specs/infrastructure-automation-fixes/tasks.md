## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order Rationale

**Priority 1 (CRITICAL)** must be completed first because it restores core automation functionality. Without these fixes, release detection doesn't work at all, requiring manual workarounds for every task completion.

**Priority 2 (IMPORTANT)** can be implemented in parallel with Priority 3 or after Priority 1. These fixes improve reliability but don't block core functionality.

**Priority 3 (MINOR)** can be implemented anytime. These are documentation and usability improvements that enhance developer experience but don't affect core functionality.

### Testing Strategy

Each priority tier includes validation tasks that use existing test scripts from the investigation:
- `test-manual-release-detection.sh` - Validates release-manager.sh execution
- `test-hook-configuration.sh` - Validates hook configuration correctness
- `test-event-emission.sh` - Detects evidence of hook triggering
- `test-file-organization.sh` - Validates file organization behavior

### Incremental Delivery

Tasks within each priority tier can be implemented incrementally:
- Each subtask is independently testable
- Subtasks can be committed separately
- Validation tasks confirm fixes work correctly
- Parent task completion confirms tier objectives met

### Parallel Work Opportunities

- Priority 2 and Priority 3 can be worked on in parallel
- Documentation tasks (2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4) can be done in parallel
- Script fixes (1.1-1.4, 2.1, 3.3) should be done sequentially to avoid conflicts

*This implementation plan provides a systematic approach to fixing infrastructure automation failures, organized by priority and validated through existing test scripts. All tasks are independently testable and can be delivered incrementally.*
