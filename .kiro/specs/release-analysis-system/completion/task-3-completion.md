## Implementation Approach

### Version Calculation Strategy
Implemented a comprehensive semantic versioning system that:

1. **Analyzes Change Types**: Examines breaking changes, features, bug fixes, and improvements
2. **Determines Bump Type**: Follows semantic versioning rules (major for breaking, minor for features, patch for fixes)
3. **Validates Progression**: Ensures version progression follows semantic versioning standards
4. **Provides Rationale**: Generates detailed explanations with supporting evidence
5. **Handles Pre-releases**: Supports alpha, beta, and RC version progression

### Release Note Generation Strategy
Built a flexible release note system that:

1. **Structures Content**: Organizes changes into logical sections with proper priority
2. **Formats Consistently**: Uses markdown formatting with configurable templates
3. **Highlights Critical Changes**: Emphasizes breaking changes with migration guidance
4. **Provides Context**: Includes descriptions, benefits, and affected components
5. **Supports Customization**: Allows template customization and styling options

### Reporting System Strategy
Created a comprehensive reporting system that:

1. **Multiple Formats**: Supports summary, detailed, and JSON output formats
2. **Configurable Options**: Allows customization of included information and formatting
3. **Quality Indicators**: Provides confidence metrics and quality analysis
4. **Persistence**: Supports saving reports to files with proper error handling
5. **User Experience**: Formats output for optimal readability and actionability

## Key Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Hierarchical Confidence Scoring
**Approach**: Implemented multi-level confidence scoring (overall, extraction, versioning, completeness)
**Rationale**: Provides granular insight into analysis quality and helps users understand reliability
**Benefits**: Enables informed decision-making and identifies areas needing manual review

### Decision 2: Evidence-Based Version Recommendations
**Approach**: Version recommendations include detailed evidence and rationale
**Rationale**: Transparency in decision-making builds trust and enables manual override when needed
**Benefits**: Users understand why specific version bumps are recommended and can validate logic

### Decision 3: Template-Based Release Notes
**Approach**: Configurable templates with section priorities and styling options
**Rationale**: Different projects have different release note requirements and formats
**Benefits**: Flexibility without sacrificing consistency, supports various organizational needs

### Decision 4: Multi-Format Reporting
**Approach**: Support for summary (CLI), detailed (human review), and JSON (programmatic) formats
**Rationale**: Different use cases require different levels of detail and different consumption methods
**Benefits**: Serves both human users and automated systems effectively

## Validation and Testing

### Test Coverage
- **VersionCalculator**: 20 tests covering all calculation scenarios, validation, and edge cases
- **ReleaseNoteGenerator**: 23 tests covering formatting, templates, and content generation
- **AnalysisReporter**: 26 tests covering all report formats, options, and error handling

### Key Test Scenarios
1. **Version Bump Logic**: Validates correct major/minor/patch decisions based on change types
2. **Semantic Versioning**: Ensures compliance with semantic versioning standards
3. **Pre-release Handling**: Tests alpha, beta, RC progression and promotion logic
4. **Release Note Formatting**: Validates markdown structure and content organization
5. **Template Application**: Tests custom templates and styling options
6. **Report Generation**: Validates all output formats and configuration options
7. **Error Handling**: Tests graceful handling of invalid inputs and edge cases

### Quality Metrics
- **All Tests Passing**: 69/69 tests pass across all three components
- **No Diagnostic Issues**: Clean TypeScript compilation with no errors or warnings
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover normal operations, edge cases, and error conditions
- **Integration Ready**: Components work together seamlessly with proper interfaces
