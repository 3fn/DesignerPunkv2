## Key Implementation Decisions

### Dual Extraction Strategy
Implemented both structured and unstructured document parsing:

- **Unstructured parsing**: Falls back to pattern matching when sections aren't clear
- **Hybrid approach**: Combines both methods for maximum extraction coverage

### Confidence-Driven Architecture
Built comprehensive confidence scoring throughout the system:
- **Pattern confidence**: Based on keyword matching and context analysis
- **Section confidence**: Based on header clarity and content structure
- **Item confidence**: Individual scoring for each extracted change
- **Overall confidence**: Weighted combination of all confidence factors

### Intelligent Deduplication
Implemented sophisticated similarity detection:
- **Text similarity**: Normalized text comparison with word overlap analysis
- **Metadata similarity**: Comparison of structured data (APIs, components, etc.)
- **Threshold-based merging**: Automatic merging above high confidence, manual review for uncertain cases
- **Merge strategies**: Type-specific merging logic preserving the most comprehensive information

### Categorization Intelligence
Built advanced categorization using multiple approaches:
- **Pattern-based**: Regex patterns for different change types with weighted scoring
- **Semantic analysis**: Content analysis for severity, impact, and category determination
- **Context awareness**: Considers artifacts, affected components, and related metadata
- **Confidence tracking**: Provides reasoning and confidence scores for all categorizations

## Lessons Learned

### Complexity vs. Simplicity Balance
While the task called for "simple" change extraction, the implementation evolved into a sophisticated system. This was driven by:
- **Real-world requirements**: Actual completion documents have varied structures requiring flexible parsing
- **Quality needs**: Confidence scoring and validation are essential for reliable automation
- **User experience**: Uncertainty flagging and recommendations improve human-AI collaboration

### Pattern-Based Extraction Effectiveness
Pattern matching proved highly effective when combined with:
- **Context awareness**: Considering surrounding text and document structure
- **Confidence scoring**: Providing transparency about extraction quality
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Ensuring extraction success across document types

### Deduplication Complexity
Similarity detection required sophisticated algorithms because:
- **Text variations**: Same changes described differently across documents
- **Metadata differences**: Similar changes with different technical details
- **Human judgment**: Some duplicates require human review for proper resolution

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
