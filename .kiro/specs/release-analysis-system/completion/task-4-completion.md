## Summary

Successfully completed systematic evaluation and integration of existing Release Management System artifacts.

The evaluation framework prevented over-engineering while capturing proven value from previous R&D work.

## Phase Overview

This task represented a critical decision point in the Release Analysis System development - determining which artifacts from the previous Release Management System justified integration based on objective value rather than sunk cost considerations. The systematic approach ensured that complexity was only added when it provided measurable benefits.
