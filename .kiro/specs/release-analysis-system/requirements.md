## Introduction

The Release Analysis System provides automatic and on-demand analysis of changes between releases, generating version bump recommendations and release notes based on completion documentation. This system follows an AI-collaboration-first approach where AI agents complete tasks and commit work, triggering automatic release analysis that provides immediate feedback on the significance of changes.

This system aligns with the AI collaboration framework by providing clear, unambiguous analysis that augments both AI agent and human decision-making. The system focuses on seamless integration with the task completion workflow while maintaining the flexibility for manual analysis when needed.

**Key Architectural Principles**:
- AI-collaboration-first design (automatic analysis on task completion)
- Seamless integration with task completion workflow
- Immediate feedback on change significance for AI agents
- On-demand detailed analysis available via CLI
- Clear separation between analysis and execution
- Structured completion document parsing

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automatic Release Analysis on Task Completion

**User Story**: As an AI agent completing tasks in the DesignerPunk system, I want automatic release analysis after committing work, so that I can immediately understand the significance of changes and provide accurate feedback to the human collaborator.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task completion commit occurs THEN the system SHALL automatically analyze all completion documents since the last release
2. WHEN completion documents exist THEN the system SHALL extract breaking changes, new features, bug fixes, and improvements
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL suggest an appropriate semantic version bump (major/minor/patch)
4. WHEN multiple types of changes exist THEN the system SHALL determine the highest significance level for version bumping
5. WHEN no significant changes are found THEN the system SHALL indicate that a release may not be warranted
6. WHEN analysis runs automatically THEN the system SHALL provide a concise summary suitable for AI agent feedback
7. WHEN automatic analysis is not desired THEN the system SHALL support configuration to disable automatic triggering

### Requirement 2: Completion Document Analysis

**User Story**: As a developer who has completed specs and tasks, I want the system to accurately extract release-relevant information from my completion documentation, so that release notes reflect the actual work accomplished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN completion documents contain structured sections THEN the system SHALL extract information from appropriate sections (Breaking Changes, New Features, Bug Fixes)
2. WHEN completion documents use unstructured formats THEN the system SHALL fall back to pattern-based extraction with high accuracy
3. WHEN documentation-only changes exist THEN the system SHALL filter these out from release-triggering changes
4. WHEN duplicate or similar changes are found THEN the system SHALL deduplicate them intelligently
5. WHEN extraction confidence is low THEN the system SHALL indicate uncertainty and request human review

### Requirement 3: Version Bump Calculation

**User Story**: As a developer preparing a release, I want accurate semantic version bump recommendations based on the types of changes detected, so that version numbers follow semantic versioning standards correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN breaking changes are detected THEN the system SHALL recommend a major version bump
2. WHEN new features are detected without breaking changes THEN the system SHALL recommend a minor version bump
3. WHEN only bug fixes or improvements are detected THEN the system SHALL recommend a patch version bump
4. WHEN pre-release versions are in use THEN the system SHALL handle pre-release version progression appropriately
5. WHEN version bump logic is uncertain THEN the system SHALL provide rationale and allow manual override

### Requirement 4: Release Note Generation

**User Story**: As a user of the DesignerPunk system, I want comprehensive release notes that clearly explain what changed in each version, so that I can understand the impact and benefits of updating.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN release analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL generate structured release notes from completion documentation
2. WHEN breaking changes exist THEN the system SHALL highlight these prominently with clear descriptions
3. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL extract feature descriptions and benefits
4. WHEN bug fixes are included THEN the system SHALL list resolved issues with clear descriptions
5. WHEN release notes are generated THEN the system SHALL format them in standard markdown format

### Requirement 5: Git Integration and Change Detection

**User Story**: As a developer using Git for version control, I want the system to automatically determine what has changed since the last release by analyzing Git history, so that I don't need to manually specify the scope of analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a release analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL identify the last release tag automatically
2. WHEN completion documents have been added since the last release THEN the system SHALL include them in analysis
3. WHEN completion documents have been modified since the last release THEN the system SHALL analyze the current versions
4. WHEN no previous release exists THEN the system SHALL analyze all available completion documents
5. WHEN Git history is unavailable or unclear THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms for specifying analysis scope

### Requirement 6: CLI Interface and Workflow

**User Story**: As a human collaborator managing releases, I want a simple command-line interface for detailed analysis and manual review, so that I can understand changes in depth and make informed release decisions when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the release analysis command manually THEN the system SHALL provide a clear summary of detected changes
2. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL present version bump recommendations with rationale
3. WHEN I want to review detailed findings THEN the system SHALL provide detailed breakdowns of detected changes
4. WHEN I want to override recommendations THEN the system SHALL allow manual specification of version bumps and release notes
5. WHEN analysis results are satisfactory THEN the system SHALL provide options to proceed with release creation or save analysis for later
6. WHEN automatic analysis has already run THEN the system SHALL allow access to cached results for quick review

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Customization

**User Story**: As a maintainer of the DesignerPunk system, I want to configure analysis behavior and customize extraction rules, so that the system adapts to evolving documentation patterns and project needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL provide a configuration file for analysis behaviors
2. WHEN completion document patterns change THEN the system SHALL allow customization of extraction rules and keywords
3. WHEN release note formatting needs adjustment THEN the system SHALL support customizable templates
4. WHEN analysis scope needs modification THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of file patterns and exclusions
5. WHEN extraction accuracy needs improvement THEN the system SHALL provide debugging and validation tools

### Requirement 8: Analysis Validation and Quality

**User Story**: As a developer relying on automated analysis, I want comprehensive validation and quality measures to ensure accurate extraction and reliable recommendations, so that the analysis enhances rather than compromises release quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL validate that completion documents are properly formatted and accessible
2. WHEN extraction occurs THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores for extracted information
3. WHEN version bump recommendations are made THEN the system SHALL provide clear rationale and supporting evidence
4. WHEN analysis quality is uncertain THEN the system SHALL highlight areas requiring human review
5. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages with resolution guidance

### Requirement 9: Task Completion Workflow Integration

**User Story**: As an AI agent using the task completion workflow, I want release analysis to integrate seamlessly with commit hooks, so that analysis happens automatically without requiring manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task completion commit is made THEN the system SHALL trigger release analysis automatically via Git hook or agent hook
2. WHEN automatic analysis runs THEN the system SHALL complete within 10 seconds to avoid disrupting workflow
3. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL provide concise output suitable for AI agent context
4. WHEN automatic analysis fails THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully without blocking the commit
5. WHEN the hook is not desired THEN the system SHALL support easy enable/disable configuration
6. WHEN multiple commits occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent analysis requests gracefully
7. WHEN analysis results are needed later THEN the system SHALL cache results for quick retrieval via CLI

## Existing Artifact Evaluation Framework

This section documents the systematic evaluation of artifacts from the previous Release Management System spec to determine their suitability for the new human-initiated approach.

### Evaluation Criteria

For each existing artifact, we will assess:

**Value Alignment:**
- Does this solve a problem the new system actually has?
- Is the complexity proportional to the value delivered?
- Would rebuilding be faster than adapting?

**Quality Assessment:**
- Is the code clean, well-tested, and maintainable?
- Does it follow sound architectural principles?
- Are there hidden dependencies or assumptions?

**Integration Fit:**
- Does it fit naturally into the new system design?
- Would keeping it force suboptimal architectural decisions?
- Can it be adapted without carrying forward unwanted complexity?
