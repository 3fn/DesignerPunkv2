# Implementation Plan: Release Detection and Infrastructure Automation Investigation

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Spec**: release-detection-infrastructure-investigation
**Status**: Implementation Planning
**Dependencies**: phase-1-discovery-audit (completed)

---

## Implementation Plan

The Release Detection and Infrastructure Automation Investigation systematically investigates infrastructure automation failures through four focused investigation areas. Each investigation traces through code, tests hypotheses, and documents root causes without implementing fixes.

This is an investigation spec - the goal is understanding, not fixing. All findings will inform subsequent fix specifications.
