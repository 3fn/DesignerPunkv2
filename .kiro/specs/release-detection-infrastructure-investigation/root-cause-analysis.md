# Root Cause Analysis: Release Detection and Infrastructure Automation Investigation

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Spec**: release-detection-infrastructure-investigation
**Status**: Investigation Complete
**Organization**: spec-validation
**Scope**: release-detection-infrastructure-investigation

---

## Executive Summary

This investigation systematically examined infrastructure automation failures across release detection hooks, agent hook system, and related automation workflows. The investigation identified **dual root causes** affecting the system:

**Primary Root Cause**: Script bug in `.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh` (line 117) where incorrect npm command syntax causes indefinite stall, preventing hook completion and causing 5-minute timeout.

**Secondary Root Cause**: Kiro IDE provides no logging for agent hook execution, making it impossible to verify event emission, hook triggering, or execution flow, significantly complicating debugging.

**Impact**: Release detection automation completely non-functional. Manual workarounds required for all release trigger detection and processing.

**Fix Complexity**: Primary fix is simple (one-line syntax correction). Secondary fix requires Kiro IDE team involvement (logging infrastructure).

**Recommended Approach**: Implement immediate script fix, add script-level logging, request IDE logging from Kiro team for long-term solution.

## Issue #001: Release Detection Hook Not Triggering (Critical)

### Issue Symptoms

**Observed Behavior**:
- Release detection hook does not execute when tasks are marked complete
- No log entries created in `.kiro/logs/release-manager.log`
- No trigger files generated in `.kiro/release-triggers/`
- Manual workaround required: `./.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto`
- Automation completely non-functional

**Expected Behavior**:
- Hook executes automatically when taskStatus tool marks task complete
- Log entries record hook execution
- Trigger files created for detected releases
- Release analysis runs automatically
- No manual intervention required

**Impact**:
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Affected Users**: All developers using spec-based development
- **Workaround**: Manual script execution required
- **Frequency**: Every task completion (100% failure rate)

### Investigation Process

#### Phase 1: System Understanding

**Intended Event Flow**:
```
Task Completion Event
    ↓
Kiro IDE emits taskStatusChange event (status="completed")
    ↓
Agent hook system receives event
    ↓
System matches event against registered hooks
    ↓
File Organization Hook executes first (requires user confirmation)
    ↓
Release Detection Hook executes after (auto-approve, runAfter dependency)
    ↓
Release Manager Script processes triggers
    ↓
TypeScript release system analyzes changes
```

**Components Involved**:
- Kiro IDE event system
- Agent hook system
- Hook configurations (organize, release-detection)
- Shell scripts (organize-after-task.sh, release-manager.sh)
- Release configuration (.kiro/release-config.json)
- TypeScript release detection system (optional)

**Dependencies**:
- Release detection depends on file organization (runAfter)
- Both hooks depend on taskStatusChange event emission
- Script depends on npm release:detect command
- System depends on proper hook registration


#### Phase 2: Behavior Tracing

**Test Method**: Manually marked task 2.2 complete using taskStatus tool

**Actual Behavior Observed**:
1. ✅ Task status updated in tasks.md (works correctly)
2. ❌ No release manager log entries created
3. ❌ No trigger files created
4. ❓ No evidence of hook execution
5. ❓ No Kiro IDE logging available

**Failure Point Identified**: Between task status update and hook execution

**Evidence**:
- Last log entry: October 28, 2025, 11:32 PM
- Last trigger file: October 28, 2025, 6:03 PM
- Test time: October 29, 2025, 11:18 AM
- Time gap: ~12 hours with no hook activity

**Historical Evidence**:
- Hooks DID work on October 22, 24, 28, 2025
- Proves hook system CAN function correctly
- Suggests recent change caused failure
- Rules out fundamental Kiro IDE issues

#### Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing

**Hypothesis 1: Hook Disabled by Default**
- **Result**: ❌ REJECTED
- **Evidence**: Configuration shows autoApprove: true, no disabled flag
- **Conclusion**: Hook is enabled and properly configured

**Hypothesis 2: Kiro IDE Not Emitting Events**
- **Result**: ❓ CANNOT VERIFY
- **Evidence**: No Kiro IDE logging available
- **Conclusion**: Cannot determine without IDE logging

**Hypothesis 3: Agent Hook System Not Supporting runAfter**
- **Result**: ❓ CANNOT VERIFY
- **Evidence**: Configuration correct, but cannot test execution
- **Conclusion**: Configuration appears correct, behavior unclear

**Hypothesis 4: Hook Configuration Not Registered**
- **Result**: ❓ CANNOT VERIFY
- **Evidence**: No way to list registered hooks
- **Conclusion**: Cannot determine without IDE UI/API

**Hypothesis 5: Script Path or Permissions Issue**
- **Result**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY CONFIRMED
- **Evidence**: Script exists, is executable, but stalls on npm command
- **Conclusion**: Script works until line 117, then stalls indefinitely

**Hypothesis 6: Two Hook Systems Conflict**
- **Result**: ❌ REJECTED
- **Evidence**: Only one hook system configured
- **Conclusion**: No conflict possible

#### Phase 4: Root Cause Analysis

**Manual Script Testing**:
```bash
$ ./.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto
[2025-10-29 11:43:09] Release manager hook started: hook_type=auto
[2025-10-29 11:43:09] Detecting release triggers: type=spec-completion
[2025-10-29 11:43:09] SUCCESS: Release trigger created
[2025-10-29 11:43:09] Attempting to process trigger with TypeScript release system...
[STALLS INDEFINITELY - NO FURTHER OUTPUT]
```

**Root Cause Identified**: Line 117 of `.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh`

**Problematic Code**:
```bash
# Line 117 - INCORRECT
if cd "$PROJECT_ROOT" && npm run release:detect process-triggers >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    success "Release trigger processed by TypeScript system"
else
    log "TypeScript release system not available, trigger queued for manual processing"
fi
```

**The Problem**:
- npm doesn't support passing arguments without `--` separator
- Command tries to run `release:detect process-triggers` (non-existent script)
- Should run `release:detect` with argument `process-triggers`
- npm hangs trying to find non-existent script
- Output redirection (`>/dev/null 2>&1`) hides error messages
- Script stalls indefinitely waiting for npm
- Agent hook times out after 5 minutes (configured timeout)
- Appears as silent failure with no visible errors

**Verification**:
```bash
# Check if script exists in package.json
$ grep "release:detect" package.json
"release:detect": "npx ts-node src/release/cli/release-detect.ts"

# Script exists, but is being called incorrectly
```

### Root Cause

**Category**: Implementation Bug (Script Error)

**Description**: The release-manager.sh script contains incorrect npm command syntax at line 117. The script attempts to run `npm run release:detect process-triggers`, but npm requires the `--` separator to pass arguments to scripts. The correct syntax is `npm run release:detect -- process-triggers`.

**Why This Causes Failure**:
1. npm tries to find a script named "release:detect process-triggers"
2. Script doesn't exist in package.json
3. npm hangs or produces error (swallowed by output redirection)
4. Script stalls indefinitely waiting for npm to complete
5. Agent hook times out after 5 minutes
6. Hook appears to fail silently with no error messages
7. No log entries created because script never completes

**Affected Systems**:
- Release detection automation (completely broken)
- Agent hook system (appears non-functional due to timeout)
- Task completion workflow (requires manual workaround)
- Release analysis system (cannot process triggers automatically)

**Related Issues**:
- Issue #003 (Agent hook triggering cannot be verified) - Same logging gap
- Issue #004 (Hook dependency chain unclear) - Amplifies impact


### Fix Recommendations

#### Fix 1: Correct npm Command Syntax (Required)

**Approach**: Change line 117 to use correct npm argument syntax

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Current (incorrect):
npm run release:detect process-triggers

# Fixed (correct):
npm run release:detect -- process-triggers
```

**Complexity**: Simple (one-line change)

**Timeline**: Immediate (< 5 minutes)

**Risks**: None - straightforward syntax correction

**Benefits**:
- Script completes successfully without stalling
- Hook execution completes within timeout
- Automation works without manual intervention
- Trigger files are processed automatically

**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - Blocks all automation

**Dependencies**: None

**Testing**: Run `tests/test-manual-release-detection.sh` to verify fix

---

#### Fix 2: Improve Error Visibility (Recommended)

**Approach**: Redirect npm output to log file instead of /dev/null

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Current (hides errors):
npm run release:detect -- process-triggers >/dev/null 2>&1

# Fixed (logs errors):
npm run release:detect -- process-triggers >> "$LOG_FILE" 2>&1
```

**Complexity**: Simple (one-line change)

**Timeline**: Immediate (< 5 minutes)

**Risks**: Log file may grow larger (minimal impact)

**Benefits**:
- npm errors visible in log file
- Easier debugging of future issues
- Better audit trail of execution
- Helps identify integration problems

**Priority**: **HIGH** - Prevents future debugging difficulties

**Dependencies**: None

**Testing**: Manually trigger script and check log file for npm output

---

#### Fix 3: Add Hook Execution Logging (Recommended)

**Approach**: Add entry point logging to verify hook triggering

**Implementation**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Add at start of release-manager.sh
LOG_FILE=".kiro/logs/release-manager.log"

# Log that hook was triggered by Kiro IDE
log "Hook triggered by Kiro IDE agent hook system"
log "Event: taskStatusChange, Status: completed"
log "Timestamp: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')"
```

**Complexity**: Simple (add 3-4 lines)

**Timeline**: Immediate (< 10 minutes)

**Risks**: None

**Benefits**:
- Provides evidence that hooks are triggering
- Helps distinguish "not triggering" from "triggering but failing"
- Enables verification of hook execution
- Supports debugging of future issues

**Priority**: **MEDIUM** - Improves debugging capability

**Dependencies**: None

**Testing**: Mark task complete and check for entry log message

---

#### Fix 4: Request Kiro IDE Logging (Long-term)

**Approach**: Request Kiro IDE team to add agent hook execution logging

**Requirements**:
- Log when taskStatusChange events are emitted
- Log when agent hook system receives events
- Log when hooks are matched against events
- Log when hooks start execution
- Log when hooks complete or fail
- Log when hooks timeout
- Provide UI or command to view hook execution history

**Complexity**: Complex (requires Kiro IDE team involvement)

**Timeline**: Long-term (depends on Kiro team priorities)

**Risks**: May not be prioritized by Kiro team

**Benefits**:
- Enables verification of event emission
- Enables verification of hook triggering
- Enables debugging of hook execution flow
- Enables verification of runAfter dependencies
- Significantly improves hook development experience

**Priority**: **MEDIUM** - Important for long-term maintainability

**Dependencies**: Kiro IDE team

**Testing**: N/A (requires IDE changes)

---

### Validation Plan

**Success Criteria**:
1. ✅ Script completes without stalling
2. ✅ Hook execution completes within timeout
3. ✅ Trigger files are created and processed
4. ✅ Log entries show complete execution
5. ✅ Automation works without manual intervention

**Validation Steps**:
1. Apply Fix 1 (correct npm syntax)
2. Run `tests/test-manual-release-detection.sh` to verify script completion
3. Mark a task complete using taskStatus tool
4. Wait 30 seconds for hook execution
5. Check `.kiro/logs/release-manager.log` for new entries
6. Check `.kiro/release-triggers/` for new trigger files
7. Verify trigger files are processed (status changes from "pending")
8. Confirm no manual intervention required

**Test Scripts**:
- `tests/test-manual-release-detection.sh` - Validates script execution
- `tests/test-hook-configuration.sh` - Validates configuration correctness
- `tests/test-event-emission.sh` - Detects evidence of hook execution

**Rollback Plan**:
- If fix causes issues, revert line 117 to original
- Use manual workaround: `./.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto`
- No data loss risk (fix only changes script behavior)

## Issue #003: Agent Hook Triggering Cannot Be Verified (Important)

### Issue Symptoms

**Observed Behavior**:
- No way to verify if Kiro IDE emits taskStatusChange events
- No way to verify if agent hook system receives events
- No way to verify if hooks are triggered
- No way to verify if hooks execute
- No way to debug hook failures
- Must rely on script-level logging and file system evidence

**Expected Behavior**:
- Kiro IDE logs when events are emitted
- Agent hook system logs when events are received
- Hook execution logs show start, completion, or failure
- UI or command available to view hook execution history
- Debugging is straightforward with clear error messages

**Impact**:
- **Severity**: Important
- **Affected Users**: All developers using agent hooks
- **Workaround**: Script-level logging and manual testing
- **Frequency**: Continuous (affects all hook development and debugging)

### Investigation Process

#### System Understanding

**How Agent Hooks Work**:
- Event-driven automation responding to IDE events
- Automatic hook registration from `.kiro/agent-hooks/` directory
- Event matching based on trigger configuration
- Configurable execution (user confirmation vs auto-approve)
- Timeout protection to prevent hanging
- Dependency-aware execution (runAfter)

**Hook Registration**:
- Automatic discovery of JSON configuration files
- No manual registration required
- Hooks registered when Kiro IDE starts
- Configuration changes require IDE restart (assumed)

**Event Types**:
- taskStatusChange (when taskStatus tool used)
- Other event types not documented

**Execution Flow**:
1. IDE tool triggers event
2. Kiro IDE emits event with metadata
3. Agent hook system matches event against hooks
4. System resolves dependencies (runAfter)
5. Hooks execute in dependency order
6. User confirmation if required
7. Script execution with timeout monitoring
8. Completion or timeout


#### Behavior Tracing

**Testing Approach**:
- Cannot test event emission directly (no logging)
- Cannot test hook triggering directly (no logging)
- Can only test for evidence of execution (logs, files)
- Must rely on historical evidence and inference

**Historical Evidence**:
- Hooks worked on October 22, 24, 28, 2025
- Proves Kiro IDE CAN emit events
- Proves agent hook system CAN trigger hooks
- Proves hooks CAN be registered correctly
- Suggests recent change caused current failure

**Current Evidence**:
- No log entries since October 28
- No trigger files since October 28
- No evidence of hook execution
- Cannot determine if hooks are triggering

#### Hypothesis Testing

**Systemic vs Isolated Failure**:
- Cannot definitively determine without IDE logging
- Historical evidence suggests NOT systemic
- Configuration analysis shows proper setup
- Assessment: Likely recent change, not fundamental flaw

**Dependency Chain Behavior**:
- Configuration shows runAfter properly configured
- Cannot test execution order without IDE events
- Cannot verify if dependencies are respected
- Manual testing required during fix validation

### Root Cause

**Category**: Kiro IDE Limitation (Missing Feature)

**Description**: Kiro IDE provides no logging mechanism for agent hook execution. There is no way to verify if events are emitted, if hooks are triggered, if hooks execute, or why hooks fail. This fundamental limitation makes debugging hook issues extremely difficult and time-consuming.

**Why This Is a Problem**:
1. Cannot verify if taskStatus tool emits events
2. Cannot verify if agent hook system receives events
3. Cannot verify if hooks are properly registered
4. Cannot verify if hooks are triggered by events
5. Cannot verify if runAfter dependencies work
6. Cannot distinguish "not triggering" from "triggering but failing"
7. Must rely on script-level logging and file system evidence
8. Debugging requires extensive manual testing and inference

**Affected Systems**:
- All agent hook development and debugging
- Release detection automation (cannot verify triggering)
- File organization automation (cannot verify triggering)
- Any future agent hooks (same limitation)

**Related Issues**:
- Issue #001 (Release detection hook not triggering) - Made debugging difficult
- Issue #004 (Hook dependency chain unclear) - Cannot verify runAfter behavior

### Fix Recommendations

#### Fix 1: Add Script-Level Entry Logging (Immediate)

**Approach**: Add logging at the start of all hook scripts

**Implementation**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
LOG_FILE=".kiro/logs/hook-name.log"

log() {
    echo "[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] $1" >> "$LOG_FILE"
}

# First line of script
log "Hook script started: $0 $@"
log "Triggered by: Kiro IDE agent hook system"
log "Event: taskStatusChange, Status: completed"
```

**Complexity**: Simple (add to each hook script)

**Timeline**: Immediate (< 30 minutes for all hooks)

**Risks**: None

**Benefits**:
- Provides evidence that hooks are triggering
- Helps distinguish "not triggering" from "triggering but failing"
- Enables basic debugging without IDE logging
- Low-effort workaround for missing IDE feature

**Priority**: **HIGH** - Immediate improvement to debugging

**Dependencies**: None

**Testing**: Mark task complete and check for entry log message

---

#### Fix 2: Request Kiro IDE Logging Feature (Long-term)

**Approach**: Submit feature request to Kiro IDE team

**Requirements**:

**Event Emission Logging**:
- Log when taskStatusChange events are emitted
- Include event metadata (task name, status, file path)
- Include timestamp and source (which tool emitted event)

**Hook Triggering Logging**:
- Log when agent hook system receives events
- Log when events are matched against hooks
- Include which hooks matched and why

**Hook Execution Logging**:
- Log when hooks start execution
- Log when hooks complete successfully
- Log when hooks fail or timeout
- Include execution time and exit code

**Dependency Chain Logging**:
- Log when hooks wait for dependencies
- Log when dependencies complete
- Log when dependency chain fails

**UI/Command for Viewing Logs**:
- Command to view recent hook executions
- UI panel showing hook execution history
- Filtering by hook name, event type, status

**Example Log Format**:
```
[2025-10-29 11:18:00] EVENT EMITTED: taskStatusChange
  Source: taskStatus tool
  Status: completed
  Task: 2.2 Trace actual release detection behavior
  File: .kiro/specs/release-detection-infrastructure-investigation/tasks.md

[2025-10-29 11:18:00] HOOKS MATCHED: 2 hooks
  - organize-after-task-completion (no dependencies)
  - release-detection-on-task-completion (depends on organize)

[2025-10-29 11:18:01] HOOK STARTED: organize-after-task-completion
  Script: .kiro/agent-hooks/organize-after-task.sh
  Timeout: 600 seconds
  Requires confirmation: true

[2025-10-29 11:18:15] HOOK COMPLETED: organize-after-task-completion
  Duration: 14 seconds
  Exit code: 0
  Files organized: 3

[2025-10-29 11:18:15] HOOK STARTED: release-detection-on-task-completion
  Script: .kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto
  Timeout: 300 seconds
  Requires confirmation: false
  Depends on: organize-after-task-completion (completed)

[2025-10-29 11:23:15] HOOK TIMEOUT: release-detection-on-task-completion
  Duration: 300 seconds (timeout)
  Exit code: 124 (timeout)
```

**Complexity**: Complex (requires Kiro IDE team development)

**Timeline**: Long-term (3-6 months, depends on Kiro priorities)

**Risks**: May not be prioritized by Kiro team

**Benefits**:
- Enables complete verification of hook execution
- Significantly improves debugging experience
- Enables verification of runAfter dependencies
- Reduces time spent debugging hook issues
- Improves developer experience with agent hooks

**Priority**: **MEDIUM** - Important for long-term maintainability

**Dependencies**: Kiro IDE team

**Testing**: N/A (requires IDE changes)

---

### Validation Plan

**Success Criteria**:
1. ✅ Script-level logging provides evidence of hook triggering
2. ✅ Can distinguish "not triggering" from "triggering but failing"
3. ✅ Debugging is faster with entry point logging
4. ⚠️ Still cannot verify IDE event emission (requires IDE logging)

**Validation Steps**:
1. Add entry logging to all hook scripts
2. Mark a task complete using taskStatus tool
3. Check log files for entry messages
4. If entry messages present: hooks are triggering
5. If no entry messages: hooks are not triggering
6. Use this information to guide further debugging

**Test Scripts**:
- `tests/test-event-emission.sh` - Detects evidence of hook execution
- Can be used to verify entry logging is working

## Issue #004: Release Manager Hook Dependency Chain Unclear (Minor)

### Issue Symptoms

**Observed Behavior**:
- Release detection hook configured with `runAfter: ["organize-after-task-completion"]`
- Documentation doesn't explain what happens if organization fails
- Documentation doesn't explain what happens if user skips organization
- Documentation doesn't explain timeout behavior
- Unclear if dependency is hard (must succeed) or soft (just order)

**Expected Behavior**:
- Clear documentation of runAfter semantics
- Clear documentation of failure handling
- Clear documentation of timeout behavior
- Clear documentation of user interaction effects

**Impact**:
- **Severity**: Minor
- **Affected Users**: Developers working with agent hooks
- **Workaround**: Trial and error, manual testing
- **Frequency**: Occasional (when developing or debugging hooks)

### Investigation Process

**Configuration Analysis**:
- File organization: `requireConfirmation: true`, 10-minute timeout
- Release detection: `autoApprove: true`, 5-minute timeout, `runAfter: ["organize"]`
- Total potential execution time: 15 minutes

**Dependency Rationale**:
> "Runs after file organization to detect release triggers from organized completion documents"

Release detection depends on organization because:
- Organization may move completion documents to proper locations
- Detection scans for completion documents
- Detection should scan organized locations, not temporary locations

**Unclear Behaviors**:
- If organization fails: Does detection run or skip?
- If user skips organization: Does detection run or skip?
- If organization times out: Does detection run or skip?
- If user cancels organization: Does detection run or skip?

### Root Cause

**Category**: Documentation Gap

**Description**: The `runAfter` setting is used to specify hook dependencies, but there is no documentation explaining what `runAfter` means, how it behaves when dependencies fail, or how it interacts with timeouts and user interactions.

**Why This Is a Problem**:
1. Developers don't know if runAfter is hard or soft dependency
2. Cannot predict behavior when dependencies fail
3. Cannot design reliable hook chains
4. Debugging dependency issues is difficult
5. May lead to unexpected behavior in production

**Affected Systems**:
- Release detection automation (depends on file organization)
- Any future hooks with dependencies
- Hook development and testing

**Related Issues**:
- Issue #001 (Release detection hook not triggering) - Dependency amplifies impact
- Issue #003 (Agent hook triggering cannot be verified) - Cannot verify dependency behavior

### Fix Recommendations

#### Fix 1: Document runAfter Behavior (Required)

**Approach**: Create comprehensive documentation of runAfter semantics

**Content to Document**:

**Basic Semantics**:
- runAfter specifies execution order, not hard dependency
- Dependent hook waits for prerequisite to complete
- Multiple dependencies supported (array of hook IDs)
- Transitive dependencies resolved automatically

**Failure Handling**:
- If prerequisite fails: Dependent hook behavior (run or skip?)
- If prerequisite is skipped: Dependent hook behavior (run or skip?)
- If prerequisite times out: Dependent hook behavior (run or skip?)
- If user cancels prerequisite: Dependent hook behavior (run or skip?)

**Timeout Behavior**:
- Each hook has independent timeout
- Timeouts don't accumulate (each hook gets full timeout)
- If prerequisite times out, dependent hook may still run

**User Interaction**:
- If prerequisite requires confirmation, dependent waits for user
- If user declines prerequisite, dependent behavior (run or skip?)
- User can cancel entire dependency chain (how?)

**Logging and Debugging**:
- How to verify dependency chain executed
- How to debug dependency issues
- Where to find dependency execution logs

**Complexity**: Simple (documentation only)

**Timeline**: Immediate (< 2 hours)

**Risks**: None

**Benefits**:
- Developers understand runAfter behavior
- Can design reliable hook chains
- Can predict behavior in edge cases
- Reduces debugging time

**Priority**: **MEDIUM** - Improves developer experience

**Dependencies**: May need to test behavior to document accurately

**Testing**: Create test hooks with dependencies and observe behavior

---

#### Fix 2: Add Explicit Failure Handling Configuration (Optional)

**Approach**: Add configuration options for dependency failure handling

**Implementation**:
```json
"settings": {
  "runAfter": ["organize-after-task-completion"],
  "continueOnFailure": true,
  "continueOnSkip": true,
  "continueOnTimeout": false
}
```

**Complexity**: Moderate (requires Kiro IDE changes)

**Timeline**: Long-term (depends on Kiro team)

**Risks**: Adds complexity to configuration

**Benefits**:
- Explicit control over failure handling
- Predictable behavior in all scenarios
- Easier to design reliable hook chains
- Self-documenting configuration

**Priority**: **LOW** - Nice to have, not critical

**Dependencies**: Kiro IDE team

**Testing**: N/A (requires IDE changes)

---

### Validation Plan

**Success Criteria**:
1. ✅ runAfter behavior is clearly documented
2. ✅ Failure handling is explained
3. ✅ Timeout behavior is explained
4. ✅ User interaction effects are explained

**Validation Steps**:
1. Create documentation for runAfter
2. Test dependency scenarios to verify documentation accuracy
3. Update hook configurations with clear comments
4. Share documentation with team for review

- **Usage**: Run after marking task complete to check for hook evidence
- **Value**: Helps distinguish "not triggering" from "triggering but failing"
- **Keep**: ✅ YES - Valuable for debugging hook issues

### Tests to Delete After Investigation

**None** - All test scripts provide ongoing value for fix validation and future debugging.

## Workflow Diagrams

### Intended Workflow

```
Task Completion Event
    ↓
Developer marks task complete using taskStatus tool
    ↓
Kiro IDE emits taskStatusChange event (status="completed")
    ↓
Agent hook system receives event
    ↓
System matches event against registered hooks
    ↓
File Organization Hook executes first
    ├─ Requires user confirmation
    ├─ Scans for files with Organization metadata
    ├─ Moves files to appropriate directories
    ├─ Updates cross-references
    └─ Completes successfully
    ↓
Release Detection Hook executes after (runAfter dependency)
    ├─ Auto-approve (no user confirmation)
    ├─ Executes release-manager.sh auto
    ├─ Scans for completion documents
    ├─ Creates trigger files
    ├─ Processes triggers with TypeScript system
    └─ Completes successfully
    ↓
Automation complete, no manual intervention required
```

### Actual Workflow (Current State)

```
Task Completion Event
    ↓
Developer marks task complete using taskStatus tool
    ↓
Task status updates in tasks.md ✅
    ↓
Kiro IDE emits taskStatusChange event? ❓ (no logging to verify)
    ↓
Agent hook system receives event? ❓ (no logging to verify)
    ↓
System matches event against hooks? ❓ (no logging to verify)
    ↓
File Organization Hook executes? ❓ (no evidence)
    ↓
Release Detection Hook executes? ❓ (no evidence)
    ↓
IF hooks execute:
    ├─ release-manager.sh starts
    ├─ Creates trigger files successfully
    ├─ Attempts npm run release:detect process-triggers
    ├─ npm command has incorrect syntax
    ├─ Script stalls indefinitely ❌
    ├─ Hook times out after 5 minutes
    └─ Appears as silent failure
    ↓
No log entries, no trigger processing, automation fails ❌
    ↓
Manual workaround required: ./.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto
```

### Workflow After Fixes

```
Task Completion Event
    ↓
Developer marks task complete using taskStatus tool
    ↓
Task status updates in tasks.md ✅
    ↓
Kiro IDE emits taskStatusChange event ✅
    ↓
Agent hook system receives event ✅
    ↓
System matches event against hooks ✅
    ↓
File Organization Hook executes ✅
    ├─ Entry logging confirms triggering
    ├─ Requires user confirmation
    ├─ Processes files
    └─ Completes successfully
    ↓
Release Detection Hook executes ✅
    ├─ Entry logging confirms triggering
    ├─ Auto-approve (no user confirmation)
    ├─ Executes release-manager.sh auto
    ├─ Creates trigger files
    ├─ Runs npm run release:detect -- process-triggers (FIXED)
    ├─ Processes triggers successfully
    └─ Completes within timeout
    ↓
Log entries show complete execution ✅
Trigger files processed automatically ✅
Automation works without manual intervention ✅
```

## Summary and Recommendations

### Primary Findings

1. **Script Bug (Critical)**: Incorrect npm syntax in release-manager.sh causes indefinite stall
2. **Logging Gap (Important)**: Kiro IDE provides no logging for agent hook execution
3. **Documentation Gap (Minor)**: runAfter behavior not documented

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix npm syntax** in `.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh` line 117
2. **Add entry logging** to all hook scripts
3. **Improve error visibility** by redirecting npm output to log file
4. **Test fixes** using provided test scripts

### Long-term Actions Recommended

1. **Request IDE logging** from Kiro team
2. **Document runAfter behavior** comprehensively
3. **Add failure handling configuration** (optional)
4. **Create hook development guide** with best practices

### Success Metrics

**Immediate Success** (after script fix):
- ✅ Hooks complete without stalling
- ✅ Automation works without manual intervention
- ✅ Log entries show complete execution
- ✅ Trigger files are processed automatically

**Long-term Success** (after IDE logging):
- ✅ Can verify event emission
- ✅ Can verify hook triggering
- ✅ Can debug hook issues efficiently
- ✅ Hook development experience significantly improved
