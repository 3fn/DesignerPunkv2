echo "=========================================="

echo "Test Scenario 1: Normal Execution"
echo "----------------------------------"
echo "Expected Behavior:"
echo "- File organization hook executes first"
echo "- User confirms or skips organization"
echo "- Release detection hook executes after organization completes"
echo "- Both hooks log their execution"
echo ""
echo "Evidence Required:"
echo "- Check .kiro/logs/release-manager.log for execution order"

echo "=========================================="

echo "❌ Cannot trigger taskStatusChange events programmatically"
echo "❌ Cannot simulate hook execution order"
echo "❌ Cannot test hook failure scenarios without actual failures"

echo "Why These Limitations Exist:"
echo "- Agent hooks are Kiro IDE internal system"
echo "- Hook triggering requires IDE events, not bash commands"
echo "- Hook execution managed by IDE, not accessible from scripts"
echo "- No public API for testing hook behavior"

echo "6. What We Can Determine from Configuration"
echo "=========================================="

echo "From Hook Configuration Analysis:"
echo "---------------------------------"
echo ""
echo "✅ Dependency Chain is Configured:"
echo "   - Release detection has 'runAfter': ['organize-after-task-completion']"
echo "   - This indicates intended execution order"
echo ""
echo "✅ Execution Settings Differ:"
echo "   - File organization: requireConfirmation=true, autoApprove=false"
echo "   - Release detection: requireConfirmation=false, autoApprove=true"
echo "   - This suggests organization is interactive, release detection is automatic"
echo ""
echo "❓ Unclear Behavior:"
echo "   - What happens if organization hook fails?"
echo "   - What happens if user cancels organization?"
echo "   - Does runAfter mean 'wait for completion' or 'wait for success'?"
echo "   - Is there error propagation between hooks?"
echo ""

echo "7. Recommended Testing Approach"
echo "=========================================="
echo ""

echo "To Actually Test Dependency Chain:"
echo "----------------------------------"
echo "1. Use taskStatus tool to mark a task complete"
echo "2. Observe file organization hook execution"
echo "3. Confirm or decline organization"
echo "4. Check if release detection hook executes after"
echo "5. Check .kiro/logs/release-manager.log for execution evidence"
echo ""
echo "To Test Failure Scenarios:"
echo "--------------------------"
echo "1. Temporarily modify organize-after-task.sh to fail"
echo "2. Mark task complete with taskStatus tool"
echo "3. Observe if release detection still runs"
echo "4. Restore organize-after-task.sh"
echo ""
echo "To Test Cancellation Scenarios:"
echo "--------------------------------"
echo "1. Mark task complete with taskStatus tool"
echo "2. Decline file organization when prompted"
echo "3. Observe if release detection still runs"
echo "4. Check logs for execution evidence"

echo "Status: Configuration Analysis Complete"
echo ""
echo "Findings:"
echo "- Dependency chain is properly configured in hook JSON"
echo "- Release detection specifies runAfter=['organize-after-task-completion']"
echo "- Cannot test actual execution behavior from bash script"
echo "- Requires Kiro IDE taskStatusChange events to test"

echo "- Document configuration findings in investigation notes"
