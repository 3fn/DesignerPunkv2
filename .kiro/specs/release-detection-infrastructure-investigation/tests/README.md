# Investigation Test Files

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Purpose**: Test files for release detection infrastructure investigation
**Organization**: spec-validation
**Scope**: release-detection-infrastructure-investigation

---

## Overview

This directory contains test scripts created during the investigation of infrastructure automation failures. These tests are used to verify hypotheses about why release detection, agent hooks, and related automation systems are not functioning as expected.

## Test File Guidelines

### Naming Convention
- Use descriptive names: `test-hook-trigger.sh` not `test1.sh`
- Prefix with `test-` to clearly identify as test files
- Use kebab-case for consistency: `test-event-emission.sh`

### Test File Structure
Each test file should include:
- Purpose comment explaining what the test verifies
- Hypothesis being tested (if applicable)
- Usage instructions
- Expected outcome description
- Clear result output (Pass/Fail/Inconclusive)

### Example Test File Format
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test: [Test Name]
# Purpose: [What this test verifies]
# Hypothesis: [What hypothesis this tests, if applicable]
# Usage: ./test-name.sh
# Expected: [What should happen if system works correctly]

set -e

echo "Testing: [Test Name]"
echo "Purpose: [Test purpose]"
echo ""

# Test implementation
# ...

echo ""
echo "Result: [Pass/Fail/Inconclusive]"
echo "Evidence: [What was observed]"
```

## Test Files

### Created Tests

The following test files have been created during the investigation:

#### Release Detection Tests

**test-manual-release-detection.sh**
- **Purpose**: Test if release-manager.sh works when invoked manually
- **Status**: Created (Task 2.3)
- **Result**: Script works but stalls on npm command (incorrect syntax)
- **Keep for Fix Spec**: Yes - validates script execution and completion

**test-hook-configuration.sh**
- **Purpose**: Analyze hook configuration files for issues
- **Status**: Created (Task 2.3)
- **Result**: Configuration is correct, no issues found
- **Keep for Fix Spec**: Yes - validates configuration remains correct

#### Agent Hook System Tests

**test-event-emission.sh**
- **Purpose**: Test for evidence of agent hook execution
- **Status**: Created (Task 3.2)
- **Result**: Requires manual execution with taskStatus tool
- **Keep for Fix Spec**: Yes - validates hooks trigger correctly

**test-dependency-chain.sh**
- **Purpose**: Document dependency chain configuration and testing approach
- **Status**: Created (Task 3.3)
- **Result**: Configuration analysis complete, manual testing required
- **Keep for Fix Spec**: Yes - documents dependency chain behavior

#### File Organization Tests
- `test-file-organization.sh` - Planned for Task 5.3 (related issues investigation)

#### Workflow Tests
- Additional workflow tests planned for Task 4 (infrastructure workflow investigation)

### Test Results

Test results will be documented in `../investigation-notes.md` with references to specific test files and their outcomes.

## Cleanup Decisions

At investigation completion, each test file will be assessed for usefulness:

- **Tests to Keep**: Useful for fix spec validation and regression testing
- **Tests to Delete**: One-time hypothesis tests with no future value

Cleanup decisions will be documented in the root cause analysis document.
