# Requirements Document: Release Detection and Infrastructure Automation Investigation

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Spec**: release-detection-infrastructure-investigation
**Status**: Requirements Phase
**Dependencies**: phase-1-discovery-audit (completed)

---

## Introduction

The Release Detection and Infrastructure Automation Investigation systematically investigates the root causes of infrastructure automation failures discovered during the Phase 1 Discovery Audit. This investigation focuses on understanding why agent hooks fail to trigger, why release detection doesn't work, and what systemic issues affect the entire infrastructure automation system.

This is an investigation spec, not an implementation spec. The goal is to understand root causes, document findings, and identify the correct fix approach - not to implement fixes. Fix specifications will be created after investigation findings are complete.

The investigation centers on Issue #001 (Critical: Release detection hook not triggering) and includes all related infrastructure automation issues to provide complete system understanding.

---

## Glossary

- **Agent Hook**: Kiro IDE automation that triggers scripts when specific events occur (e.g., taskStatusChange)
- **Release Detection**: Automated system that detects spec completions and triggers release analysis
- **Infrastructure Automation**: All automated workflows including hooks, release detection, file organization, and task completion
- **Root Cause**: The fundamental reason an issue occurs, not just its symptoms
- **Investigation**: Systematic process of tracing through code, testing hypotheses, and documenting findings to understand why something is broken
- **taskStatus Tool**: Kiro IDE tool for marking tasks complete, intended to trigger agent hooks
- **Hook Dependency Chain**: Sequence of hooks that run in order (e.g., file organization before release detection)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Release Detection Hook Investigation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand why release detection hooks don't trigger when tasks are marked complete, so that I can design the correct fix approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the release detection investigation is conducted, THEN the investigation SHALL trace through the complete event flow from taskStatus tool invocation to hook execution

2. WHEN the event flow is traced, THEN the investigation SHALL document each step in the flow including Kiro IDE event emission, agent hook system event reception, hook configuration matching, and script execution

3. WHEN the investigation examines hook configuration, THEN the investigation SHALL verify that `.kiro/agent-hooks/release-detection-on-task-completion.json` is properly formatted and registered with Kiro IDE

4. WHEN the investigation examines the release manager script, THEN the investigation SHALL verify that `.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh` executes correctly when invoked manually

5. WHEN the investigation tests hook triggering, THEN the investigation SHALL attempt to trigger the hook using different methods including taskStatus tool, manual task status changes, and direct script invocation

6. WHEN the investigation identifies the failure point, THEN the investigation SHALL document whether the issue is in Kiro IDE event emission, agent hook system, hook configuration, or script execution

7. WHEN the investigation is complete, THEN the investigation SHALL produce a root cause analysis document explaining exactly why release detection fails and what needs to be fixed

8. THE investigation SHALL NOT implement fixes for release detection issues

---

### Requirement 2: Agent Hook System Investigation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand how the agent hook system works and why hooks don't trigger, so that I can determine if this is a systemic issue affecting all hooks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent hook system investigation is conducted, THEN the investigation SHALL document how Kiro IDE's agent hook system is designed to work including event types, hook registration, and execution flow

2. WHEN the investigation examines hook triggering, THEN the investigation SHALL test whether ANY agent hooks trigger on taskStatusChange events or if this is a systemic failure

3. WHEN the investigation examines the file organization hook, THEN the investigation SHALL determine if `.kiro/agent-hooks/organize-after-task-completion.json` has the same triggering issues as release detection

4. WHEN the investigation examines hook dependencies, THEN the investigation SHALL document how the `runAfter` setting works and whether dependency chains execute correctly

5. WHEN the investigation examines hook logging, THEN the investigation SHALL determine if there is any logging mechanism for agent hook execution and if not, what logging would be needed for verification

6. WHEN the investigation identifies patterns, THEN the investigation SHALL document whether hook failures are isolated to specific hooks or affect the entire agent hook system

7. WHEN the investigation is complete, THEN the investigation SHALL produce findings explaining whether this is a configuration issue, a Kiro IDE bug, or a design issue

8. THE investigation SHALL NOT implement fixes for agent hook triggering issues

---

### Requirement 3: Infrastructure Automation Workflow Investigation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand the complete infrastructure automation workflow and its dependencies, so that I can identify where the workflow breaks down.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the infrastructure workflow investigation is conducted, THEN the investigation SHALL document the complete intended workflow from task completion through release analysis including all automation steps

2. WHEN the investigation examines task completion, THEN the investigation SHALL trace how `commit-task.sh` is intended to work and whether it integrates correctly with the agent hook system

3. WHEN the investigation examines file organization, THEN the investigation SHALL determine if file organization automation works correctly and whether it affects release detection

4. WHEN the investigation examines workflow dependencies, THEN the investigation SHALL document which automation steps depend on others and what happens when dependencies fail

5. WHEN the investigation examines manual workarounds, THEN the investigation SHALL document which parts of the workflow work when triggered manually versus automatically

6. WHEN the investigation identifies workflow gaps, THEN the investigation SHALL document where automation is intended but not working versus where manual steps are expected

7. WHEN the investigation is complete, THEN the investigation SHALL produce a workflow diagram showing intended flow, actual flow, and failure points

8. THE investigation SHALL NOT implement fixes for workflow automation issues

---

### Requirement 4: Related Infrastructure Issues Investigation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand all related infrastructure issues in context of the release detection failure, so that I can determine if they share root causes or require separate fixes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN related issues are investigated, THEN the investigation SHALL examine Issue #002 (commit-task.sh --help handling) to determine if it's related to the same automation system issues

2. WHEN related issues are investigated, THEN the investigation SHALL examine Issue #004 (hook dependency chain unclear) to determine if dependency chain issues contribute to release detection failure

3. WHEN related issues are investigated, THEN the investigation SHALL examine Issue #005 (file organization metadata validation) to determine if validation issues affect automation reliability

4. WHEN related issues are investigated, THEN the investigation SHALL examine Issue #006 (cross-reference update logic) to determine if path calculation issues affect file organization automation

5. WHEN related issues are investigated, THEN the investigation SHALL examine Issue #007 (file organization scope limitation) to determine if scope limitations are intentional design or implementation gaps

6. WHEN relationships are identified, THEN the investigation SHALL document which issues share root causes and which are independent problems

7. WHEN the investigation is complete, THEN the investigation SHALL provide recommendations on whether issues should be fixed together or separately

8. THE investigation SHALL NOT implement fixes for related infrastructure issues

## Investigation Principles

### Root Cause Focus

The investigation focuses on understanding WHY things are broken, not just WHAT is broken:

**Surface Symptoms (Already Known from Discovery):**
- Release detection hook doesn't trigger
- No log entries created
- No trigger files generated
- Manual workaround required

**Root Causes (What Investigation Must Find):**
- Is Kiro IDE emitting taskStatusChange events?
- Is the agent hook system receiving events?
- Is hook configuration properly registered?
- Are there dependency chain issues?
- Is this a Kiro IDE bug or our configuration issue?

### Systematic Approach

The investigation follows a systematic process:

1. **Understand Intended Design**: How is it supposed to work?
2. **Trace Actual Behavior**: What actually happens?
3. **Identify Failure Point**: Where does it break?
4. **Test Hypotheses**: Why does it break there?
5. **Document Findings**: What's the root cause?

### Strict "Look, Don't Touch" Policy

This investigation follows a strict no-modification policy to preserve investigation integrity and maintain evidence in original state.

**Allowed Activities:**
- Reading code to understand behavior
- Running existing scripts to test behavior
- Creating NEW test files in investigation directory (`.kiro/specs/release-detection-infrastructure-investigation/tests/`)
- Documenting findings with evidence
- Taking investigation notes
- Recommending fix approaches

**Prohibited Activities:**
- Modifying ANY existing code (including syntax fixes)
- Changing configuration files
- Refactoring code
- Implementing workarounds
- "Quick fixes" even for obvious errors
- Creating test files outside investigation directory

**Rationale:** 
- Preserves investigation integrity
- Maintains evidence in original state
- Prevents scope creep from "just fixing this small thing"
- Ensures findings are based on actual system state
- Avoids invalidating investigation by changing what's being investigated

**If Syntax Errors or Bugs Are Found:**
- Document them in investigation notes
- Assess whether they contribute to the investigated issue
- Include them in root cause analysis
- Add them to the list of issues to fix in subsequent fix spec
- Do NOT fix them during investigation

### Investigation Test Files

**Creating Test Files:**
- Test files MUST be created in `.kiro/specs/release-detection-infrastructure-investigation/tests/` directory
- Test files MUST NOT be created in production code directories (`.kiro/hooks/`, `.kiro/agent-hooks/`, etc.)
- Test files MUST include comments explaining their purpose and what they test
- Test files MUST be documented in investigation notes with results
- Test file directory MUST include `README.md` explaining what each test does

**Test File Naming:**
- Use descriptive names: `test-hook-trigger.sh` not `test1.sh`
- Prefix with `test-` to clearly identify as test files
- Use kebab-case for consistency: `test-event-emission.sh`

**Test File Cleanup:**
- At investigation completion, assess each test file for usefulness to fix spec
- Tests useful for fix spec validation SHOULD be kept and documented in root cause analysis
- Tests only useful for one-time hypothesis testing SHOULD be deleted
- Cleanup decisions MUST be documented in root cause analysis under "Investigation Test Files" section
- Kept tests SHOULD be referenced in fix spec recommendations

**Test File Documentation in Root Cause Analysis:**
```markdown
## Investigation Test Files

### Tests to Keep for Fix Spec
- `tests/test-hook-trigger.sh` - Validates hook triggering works correctly
  - Purpose: Tests if agent hooks can be triggered manually
  - Usage: Run after implementing hook fixes to verify they work
  
- `tests/test-event-emission.sh` - Verifies Kiro IDE event emission
  - Purpose: Tests if taskStatusChange events are emitted
  - Usage: Run to verify event system is working

### Tests to Delete After Investigation
- `tests/test-hypothesis-1.sh` - One-time test for hypothesis about event timing
- `tests/test-hypothesis-2.sh` - One-time test for hook configuration format
```
