# Task 2.1 Completion: Document Intended Release Detection Design

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Task**: 2.1 Document intended release detection design
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete
**Organization**: spec-completion
**Scope**: release-detection-infrastructure-investigation

---

## Artifacts Created

- Updated `.kiro/specs/release-detection-infrastructure-investigation/investigation-notes.md` with comprehensive intended design documentation

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Documented the intended release detection design by reading and analyzing three key configuration and implementation files:

1. **Agent Hook Configuration**: `.kiro/agent-hooks/release-detection-on-task-completion.json`
2. **Release Manager Script**: `.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh`
3. **Release Configuration**: `.kiro/release-config.json`
4. **File Organization Hook**: `.kiro/agent-hooks/organize-after-task-completion.json` (for dependency understanding)

The documentation captures the complete intended event flow from task completion through release analysis, identifying all components, dependencies, and integration points.

### Key Findings

**Event Flow Design**:
The system is designed as an 8-step automated workflow:
1. Task completion via `taskStatus` tool
2. Kiro IDE event emission
3. Agent hook system reception
4. Hook matching
5. File organization hook execution (first)
6. Release detection hook execution (second, via `runAfter`)
7. Release manager processing
8. Release analysis

**Critical Dependency Chain**:
The release detection hook explicitly depends on file organization completing first via `runAfter: ["organize-after-task-completion"]`. This is intentional - file organization may move completion documents to proper locations before release detection scans for them.

**Trigger Detection Logic**:
The system detects two types of triggers:
- **Spec Completion**: Scans `.kiro/specs/*/completion/` for completion documents
- **Task Completion**: Checks git commit messages for "Task.*Complete" pattern

**Integration Points**:
The release manager integrates with:
- Commit workflow (can detect task completion commits)
- File organization (runs after organization completes)
- TypeScript release system (attempts immediate processing if available)
- Manual triggering (CLI interface for testing)

### Components Documented

**Kiro IDE Components**:
- Event system (emits `taskStatusChange` events)
- Agent hook system (receives events, matches hooks, executes scripts)
- Hook dependency manager (manages `runAfter` chains)

**Hook Configurations**:
- File organization hook (runs first, requires confirmation)
- Release detection hook (runs second, auto-approved, 5-minute timeout)

**Shell Scripts**:
- Release manager (detects triggers, creates trigger files, integrates with TypeScript system)
- File organization (scans for metadata, moves files, updates cross-references)

**Configuration Files**:
- Release config (enables/disables triggers, defines version bump rules)

**TypeScript Release System** (optional):
- Release detector, change analyzer, version calculator, release note generator

**File System Components**:
- Trigger directory, log file, completion documents

### Dependencies Identified

**Hook Dependency Chain**:
```
taskStatusChange event
    ↓
organize-after-task-completion (runs first)
    ↓
release-detection-on-task-completion (runs after)
```

**System Dependencies**:
- Kiro IDE (must emit events)
- Agent hook system (must support `runAfter`)
- Git (for commit detection)
- Node.js/npm (optional, for TypeScript system)
- File system (write access to logs and triggers)

**Configuration Dependencies**:
- Release config must exist with detection enabled
- Hook configurations must be registered
- Directory structure must exist

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors in investigation notes
✅ Markdown formatting correct
✅ All file paths referenced are accurate

### Functional Validation
✅ Complete event flow documented (8 steps from task completion to release analysis)
✅ All components identified and described
✅ Dependencies mapped with rationale
✅ Integration points documented with examples
✅ Trigger detection logic explained with file format

### Integration Validation
✅ Documentation integrates with investigation notes template structure
✅ References to actual configuration files verified
✅ Hook dependency chain matches actual configuration
✅ File paths match actual project structure

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 1.1: Complete event flow documented from taskStatus to release analysis
✅ Requirement 1.1: Each step in flow identified and explained
✅ Requirement 1.1: All components involved identified (Kiro IDE, hooks, scripts, configs)
✅ Requirement 1.1: Dependencies documented (runAfter file organization)
✅ Requirement 1.1: Findings recorded in investigation notes

## Investigation Insights

### Intended Design Strengths

**Clear Separation of Concerns**:
- File organization handles metadata-driven file moves
- Release detection handles trigger creation and processing
- Each hook has single, well-defined responsibility

**Dependency Management**:
- Explicit `runAfter` dependency ensures correct execution order
- File organization completes before release detection scans
- Prevents race conditions between hooks

**Flexible Integration**:
- Multiple trigger points (commit, organize, manual)
- Optional TypeScript system integration
- Falls back gracefully if TypeScript unavailable

**Comprehensive Logging**:
- All activity logged to `.kiro/logs/release-manager.log`
- Trigger files include full metadata (git info, timestamps, workflow context)
- Status command provides system health check

### Potential Design Issues

**Dependency on Kiro IDE Events**:
- System only works if Kiro IDE emits `taskStatusChange` events
- Direct git commits bypass the entire automation
- No way to verify if events are being emitted

**Hook Chain Complexity**:
- Two-hook dependency chain adds complexity
- If file organization fails, release detection may not run
- No clear error handling for dependency failures

**Auto-Approve Risk**:
- Release detection runs with `autoApprove: true`
- No user confirmation before creating trigger files
- Could create unwanted triggers if logic is faulty

**TypeScript System Dependency**:
- Attempts to process triggers immediately if npm available
- Falls back to queued processing if unavailable
- No clear indication of which mode is active

### Questions for Next Investigation Steps

1. **Does Kiro IDE actually emit `taskStatusChange` events?**
   - Need to verify event emission is working
   - Check if events are logged anywhere
   - Test with different task status changes

2. **Does the agent hook system support `runAfter` dependencies?**
   - Need to verify dependency chain execution
   - Check if file organization completes before release detection
   - Test what happens if dependency hook fails

3. **Are hook configurations properly registered?**
   - Need to verify Kiro IDE recognizes the hooks
   - Check if hooks appear in any Kiro IDE UI
   - Test if hooks can be manually triggered

4. **What happens when dependencies fail?**
   - If file organization fails, does release detection still run?
   - Are there error logs for dependency failures?
   - Is there a way to retry failed hooks?

## Next Steps

Based on this documentation of intended design, the next investigation steps are:

1. **Trace Actual Behavior** (Task 2.2):
   - Manually mark task complete using `taskStatus` tool
   - Observe what actually happens at each step
   - Check logs for evidence of execution
   - Identify where actual behavior deviates from intended

2. **Test Hypotheses** (Task 2.3):
   - Formulate hypotheses about why release detection fails
   - Create test scripts to verify hypotheses
   - Execute tests and document results

3. **Document Root Cause** (Task 2.4):
   - Synthesize findings from design understanding and behavior tracing
   - Identify root cause of release detection failure
   - Recommend fix approach
