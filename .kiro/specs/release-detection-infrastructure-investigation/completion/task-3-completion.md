# Task 3 Completion: Investigate Agent Hook System

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Task**: 3. Investigate Agent Hook System
**Type**: Parent
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

### Primary Artifacts

- **Root Cause Analysis for Issue #003**: Comprehensive analysis in `investigation-notes.md` (Investigation Area 2)
- **Agent Hook System Documentation**: Complete documentation of how Kiro IDE agent hooks work
- **Test Scripts for Hook Verification**: Three test scripts for validating hook behavior

### Supporting Artifacts

- **Task 3.1 Completion**: Agent hook system design documentation
- **Task 3.2 Completion**: Hook triggering test results and analysis
- **Task 3.3 Completion**: Dependency chain investigation findings
- **Task 3.4 Completion**: Root cause synthesis and fix recommendations

## Success Criteria Verification

### Criterion 1: Agent hook system behavior understood

**Evidence**: Comprehensive documentation in investigation notes covering:
- ✅ Event-driven automation model
- ✅ Automatic hook registration process
- ✅ Event types and matching logic (taskStatusChange)
- ✅ Hook execution flow from event to completion
- ✅ Dependency chain behavior (runAfter)
- ✅ Timeout and error handling
- ✅ User confirmation vs auto-approve settings

**Verification**: Task 3.1 documented complete agent hook system design based on configuration analysis and available documentation.

### Criterion 2: Hook triggering mechanism documented

**Evidence**: Detailed documentation of triggering mechanism:
- ✅ How Kiro IDE emits events (taskStatusChange when taskStatus tool used)
- ✅ How agent hook system receives and matches events
- ✅ How hooks are registered (automatic discovery in .kiro/agent-hooks/)
- ✅ How execution is triggered (event matching + dependency resolution)
- ✅ **Critical Finding**: Kiro IDE provides NO logging for hook execution

**Verification**: Task 3.2 created comprehensive test approach for detecting hook execution through observable side effects, given the lack of IDE logging.

### Criterion 3: Systemic vs isolated failure determined

**Evidence**: Analysis of failure scope:
- ⚠️ **Cannot definitively determine** due to lack of Kiro IDE logging
- ✅ Historical evidence shows hooks worked October 22-28, 2025
- ✅ Configuration analysis shows both hooks properly configured
- ✅ Script testing shows release-manager.sh works until npm command
- ✅ **Assessment**: Likely NOT systemic (hooks CAN work), but recent change caused failure

**Verification**: Task 3.2 and 3.4 analyzed available evidence and concluded that while definitive determination requires IDE logging, historical evidence suggests this is not a fundamental systemic failure but rather a recent issue (likely npm behavior change).

### Criterion 4: Logging gaps identified

**Evidence**: Comprehensive identification of logging gaps:
- ❌ No logging for event emission (when taskStatus tool used)
- ❌ No logging for hook triggering (when events match hooks)
- ❌ No logging for hook execution start
- ❌ No logging for hook completion or failure
- ❌ No logging for timeout events
- ❌ No logging for dependency chain resolution
- ❌ No UI or command to view hook execution history
- ✅ Only script-level logging available (if scripts implement it)

**Verification**: Task 3.1 and 3.4 documented comprehensive logging requirements for Kiro IDE team, including specific examples of what should be logged and how it would enable debugging.

## Overall Integration Story

### Complete Investigation Workflow

The agent hook system investigation followed a systematic approach across four subtasks:

**Task 3.1: System Understanding**
- Researched how Kiro IDE agent hooks work
- Documented hook registration, event matching, and execution flow
- Identified critical logging gap as fundamental limitation
- Provided foundation for understanding intended behavior

**Task 3.2: Hook Triggering Tests**
- Created test script to detect evidence of hook execution
- Analyzed git history to understand when hooks worked vs failed
- Discovered npm syntax bug existed when hooks were working
- Concluded npm behavior likely changed between October 28 and now

**Task 3.3: Dependency Chain Investigation**
- Analyzed hook dependency chain configuration
- Documented intended execution order (file organization → release detection)
- Identified testing limitations (cannot trigger IDE events from bash)
- Provided manual testing recommendations for fix validation

**Task 3.4: Root Cause Synthesis**
- Synthesized findings from all three investigation tasks
- Identified dual root cause (logging gap + script bug)
- Provided prioritized fix recommendations
- Established validation plan and success criteria

### Subtask Contributions

**Task 3.1 Contribution**:
- Established understanding of agent hook system design
- Identified logging gap as primary investigation challenge
- Provided context for interpreting other findings
- Informed testing approach for subsequent tasks

**Task 3.2 Contribution**:
- Created systematic approach for detecting hook execution
- Provided historical evidence that hooks CAN work
- Identified npm behavior change as likely cause
- Developed test script for fix validation

**Task 3.3 Contribution**:
- Confirmed dependency chain configuration is correct
- Documented testing limitations clearly
- Provided manual testing protocol for fix spec
- Identified questions requiring IDE-level testing

**Task 3.4 Contribution**:
- Synthesized all findings into comprehensive root cause analysis
- Identified both immediate (script bug) and long-term (logging) fixes
- Prioritized fixes by impact and feasibility
- Established clear success criteria for validation

### System Behavior

**Intended Behavior**:
```
Task Completion Event
    ↓
Kiro IDE emits taskStatusChange event
    ↓
Agent hook system receives event
    ↓
System matches event against registered hooks
    ↓
File Organization Hook executes (requires user confirmation)
    ↓
Release Detection Hook executes (auto-approve, depends on organization)
    ↓
Hooks complete successfully within timeout
```

**Actual Behavior** (Based on Investigation):
```
Task Completion Event
    ↓
Kiro IDE emits taskStatusChange event (ASSUMED - no logging to verify)
    ↓
Agent hook system receives event (ASSUMED - no logging to verify)
    ↓
System matches event against registered hooks (ASSUMED - no logging to verify)
    ↓
File Organization Hook executes? (UNKNOWN - no evidence)
    ↓
Release Detection Hook executes? (UNKNOWN - no evidence)
    ↓
IF hooks execute: Script stalls on incorrect npm command
    ↓
Hook times out after 5 minutes (configured timeout)
    ↓
Appears as silent failure (no logging)
```

**Key Uncertainty**: Cannot verify if hooks are triggering at all due to lack of IDE logging. Historical evidence suggests they CAN trigger, but current behavior is unknown.

### User-Facing Capabilities Impact

**Before Investigation**:
- ❌ No visibility into hook execution
- ❌ Cannot verify automation is working
- ❌ Cannot debug hook failures
- ❌ Must rely on manual workarounds

**After Investigation**:
- ✅ Understanding of how hooks should work
- ✅ Test scripts for detecting hook execution
- ✅ Clear identification of root causes
- ✅ Prioritized fix recommendations
- ✅ Validation plan for fixes
- ⚠️ Still cannot verify hook triggering without IDE logging

**After Fixes** (Expected):
- ✅ Hooks execute successfully without stalling
- ✅ Script-level logging provides execution evidence
- ✅ Automation works reliably
- ⚠️ Still limited by lack of IDE logging for debugging

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Focus on Configuration Analysis Over Execution Testing

**Options Considered**:
1. Attempt to trigger hooks programmatically from bash scripts
2. Focus on configuration analysis and manual testing recommendations
3. Request Kiro IDE team to add testing API

**Decision**: Focus on configuration analysis and manual testing recommendations

**Rationale**: 
Bash scripts cannot trigger Kiro IDE events (taskStatusChange), making programmatic testing impossible. Configuration analysis provides maximum value given this constraint, and manual testing recommendations enable validation during fix implementation.

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Thorough understanding of intended behavior, clear testing protocol
- ❌ **Lost**: Automated validation of hook execution
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Manual testing required for validation

### Decision 2: Identify Dual Root Cause (Logging Gap + Script Bug)

**Options Considered**:
1. Focus only on script bug (immediate fix)
2. Focus only on logging gap (long-term fix)
3. Identify both as dual root cause

**Decision**: Identify both as dual root cause with prioritization

**Rationale**:
The script bug is an immediate, fixable issue that blocks all testing. The logging gap is a fundamental limitation that affects all hook development and debugging. Both must be addressed for complete solution.

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Comprehensive fix approach, both immediate and long-term solutions
- ❌ **Lost**: None - both issues are real and must be addressed
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Long-term fix depends on Kiro IDE team

### Decision 3: Cannot Definitively Determine Systemic vs Isolated

**Options Considered**:
1. Conclude it's systemic (all hooks fail)
2. Conclude it's isolated (specific hooks fail)
3. Acknowledge cannot determine without logging

**Decision**: Acknowledge cannot determine, but provide assessment based on evidence

**Rationale**:
Without IDE logging, cannot definitively determine if hooks are triggering at all. However, historical evidence (hooks worked October 22-28) suggests this is NOT a fundamental systemic failure but rather a recent issue.

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Honest assessment of investigation limitations
- ❌ **Lost**: Definitive answer to systemic vs isolated question
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Fix approach must address both possibilities

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

**Systematic Investigation Approach**:
- Following the investigation methodology from design document ensured comprehensive coverage
- Each subtask built on previous findings
- Root cause analysis synthesized all findings effectively

**Configuration Analysis**:
- Thorough configuration analysis provided maximum value given testing limitations
- Understanding intended behavior informed fix recommendations
- Configuration validation confirmed setup is correct

**Historical Evidence**:
- Checking git history and logs for when things worked provided crucial context
- Helped distinguish between fundamental flaws and recent changes
- Informed assessment of systemic vs isolated failure

**Test Script Development**:
- Creating systematic test scripts provided repeatable validation approach
- Scripts will be valuable for fix validation and future debugging
- Clear documentation of testing limitations sets appropriate expectations

### Challenges

**Cannot Verify Hook Triggering**:
- Lack of Kiro IDE logging made it impossible to verify if hooks are triggering
- Required reliance on historical evidence and inference
- Made definitive determination of systemic vs isolated impossible

**Bash Script Limitations**:
- Cannot trigger Kiro IDE events from bash scripts
- Cannot test hook execution order programmatically
- Cannot verify runAfter dependency behavior without IDE events

**Long-term Fix Dependency**:
- Primary issue (logging gap) requires Kiro IDE team involvement
- Cannot be fixed by developers alone
- Creates dependency on external team for complete solution

### Future Considerations

**Request IDE Logging Early**:
- For future projects using agent hooks, request comprehensive logging from Kiro IDE team early
- Logging should be considered essential infrastructure, not optional feature
- Provide specific requirements and examples to Kiro team

**Always Add Entry Logging**:
- All hook scripts should log at entry point to provide evidence of triggering
- Even if IDE logging is unavailable, script logging provides some visibility
- Use consistent log format across all hooks

**Test Manually First**:
- Always test hook scripts manually before configuring as agent hooks
- Ensure scripts work correctly in isolation
- Verify scripts complete within expected timeout

**Document Testing Limitations**:
- Clearly document what can and cannot be tested from bash scripts
- Provide manual testing instructions for IDE-dependent behavior
- Set appropriate expectations for investigation scope

## Integration Points
