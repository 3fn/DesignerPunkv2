# Task 3.1 Completion: Document Agent Hook System Design

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Task**: 3.1 Document agent hook system design
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- Updated `.kiro/specs/release-detection-infrastructure-investigation/investigation-notes.md` with comprehensive agent hook system documentation in Investigation Area 2

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Researched the Kiro IDE agent hook system by examining existing hook configurations, documentation, and workflow integration. Documented findings in the investigation notes under Investigation Area 2: Agent Hook System.

The research focused on understanding:
1. How agent hooks work (event-driven automation)
2. Hook registration process (automatic discovery)
3. Event types and matching logic (taskStatusChange events)
4. Hook execution flow (event → matching → execution → completion)
5. Dependency chain behavior (runAfter dependencies)
6. Logging mechanisms (script-level only, no IDE logging)

### Research Sources

**Hook Configurations**:
- `.kiro/agent-hooks/release-detection-on-task-completion.json` - Release detection hook configuration
- `.kiro/agent-hooks/organize-after-task-completion.json` - File organization hook configuration

**Documentation**:
- `.kiro/agent-hooks/README.md` - Agent hook system overview and integration guide
- `.kiro/steering/Development Workflow.md` - Task completion workflow and hook integration

**Analysis Method**:
- Examined JSON configuration structure to understand hook format
- Analyzed trigger types and action configurations
- Reviewed settings for confirmation, timeout, and dependency behavior
- Identified patterns in how hooks are configured and executed

### Key Findings

#### 1. Event-Driven Automation Model

Agent hooks use an event-driven model where:
- Kiro IDE emits events when actions occur (like task status changes)
- Agent hook system matches events against registered hook triggers
- Matching hooks execute automatically (with optional user confirmation)
- Hooks can specify execution order via `runAfter` dependencies

This model enables automatic workflows without manual triggering.

#### 2. Automatic Hook Registration

Hooks are automatically discovered and registered:
- Kiro IDE scans `.kiro/agent-hooks/` directory for JSON files
- No manual registration commands required
- Hooks become active as soon as JSON file is created
- Changes to JSON files are detected automatically

This simplifies hook deployment and management.

#### 3. taskStatusChange Event Type

The primary event type used by infrastructure automation:
- Triggered when `taskStatus` tool updates task status
- Includes status value: `"completed"`, `"in_progress"`, `"not_started"`
- Multiple hooks can respond to same event
- Event data includes task name, status, and file path

Both file organization and release detection hooks use this event type.

#### 4. Dependency Chain Support

The `runAfter` setting enables hook execution ordering:
- Hooks can specify prerequisite hooks that must complete first
- System automatically resolves execution order
- Supports multiple dependencies (array of hook IDs)
- Enables complex workflows with proper sequencing

Example: Release detection depends on file organization completing first.

#### 5. Critical Logging Gap

**Major Finding**: Kiro IDE provides **no logging** for agent hook execution:
- No logs showing when events are emitted
- No logs showing when hooks are triggered
- No logs showing hook execution or completion
- No logs showing failures or timeouts
- No UI or command to view hook history

**Impact**: Makes debugging hook issues extremely difficult. Cannot verify:
- If events are emitted when `taskStatus` tool is used
- If hooks are triggered by events
- If hooks are properly registered
- If `runAfter` dependencies work correctly
- Why hooks fail or don't execute

**Workaround**: Hooks must implement their own script-level logging to provide any visibility into execution.

#### 6. Hook Configuration Structure

Standard hook configuration format:
```json
{
  "name": "Human-readable name",
  "id": "unique-identifier",
  "trigger": {
    "type": "eventType",
    "status": "eventStatus"
  },
  "action": {
    "type": "actionType",
    "script": "path/to/script.sh",
    "args": ["arguments"]
  },
  "settings": {
    "requireConfirmation": true/false,
    "timeout": 300,
    "autoApprove": true/false,
    "runAfter": ["prerequisite-hook-id"]
  }
}
```

All fields are required except `runAfter` (optional for dependencies).

### Documentation Structure

Added comprehensive documentation to Investigation Area 2 with these sections:

1. **How Agent Hooks Work**: Overview of event-driven automation model
2. **Hook Registration Process**: Automatic discovery and registration
3. **Event Types and Matching Logic**: taskStatusChange events and matching behavior
4. **Hook Execution Flow**: Complete flow from event to completion
5. **Dependency Chain Behavior**: runAfter dependencies and execution ordering
6. **Logging Mechanisms**: Script-level logging and IDE logging gap

Each section includes:
- Detailed explanations of behavior
- Configuration examples
- Execution flow diagrams
- Best practices and recommendations
- Known limitations and gaps

### Integration with Previous Investigation

This documentation builds on findings from Investigation Area 1 (Release Detection Hook Failure):

**Confirms Previous Findings**:
- Hook configuration is correct (validated in Task 2.3)
- Dependency chain exists (release detection depends on file organization)
- No IDE logging available (explains why we couldn't verify hook triggering)

**Provides Context for Root Cause**:
- Explains why script stall causes hook timeout (5-minute timeout configured)
- Explains why hook failures appear silent (no IDE logging)
- Explains why we can't verify if hooks trigger (no event emission logs)

**Informs Fix Approach**:
- Script-level logging is the only visibility mechanism
- Hooks must complete within timeout to avoid appearing as failures
- User confirmation can block automation (file organization requires confirmation)

## Key Insights

### 1. Agent Hooks Are Powerful But Opaque

The agent hook system provides powerful automation capabilities:
- Event-driven workflows
- Automatic execution
- Dependency management
- User confirmation options

But the lack of IDE logging makes them difficult to debug and verify.

### 2. Script-Level Logging Is Essential

Since Kiro IDE provides no hook execution logging, comprehensive script-level logging is the **only way** to:
- Verify hooks are executing
- Debug hook failures
- Track execution flow
- Identify timeout issues

Every hook script should implement detailed logging from the first line.

### 3. Dependency Chains Add Complexity

The `runAfter` dependency feature enables complex workflows but adds:
- Additional failure points (if prerequisite fails, dependent may not run)
- Execution order complexity (must understand full dependency chain)
- Debugging challenges (can't verify dependency resolution without IDE logging)

Dependencies should be used judiciously and well-documented.

### 4. Timeout Configuration Is Critical

Hook timeout settings determine how long scripts can run:
- Too short: Scripts may timeout before completing
- Too long: Failed scripts hang for extended periods
- Default: Unknown (not documented)

Timeout should be set based on expected script execution time with buffer for variability.

### 5. User Confirmation Blocks Automation

Hooks with `requireConfirmation: true` require user interaction:
- Blocks automation until user responds
- User can decline, preventing hook execution
- Adds friction to workflow

Use `autoApprove: true` for fully automatic workflows, but ensure scripts are safe and well-tested.

## Recommendations

### For Fix Specification

1. **Add Comprehensive Script Logging**: Ensure all hook scripts log entry, actions, and completion
2. **Verify Timeout Settings**: Confirm timeout values are appropriate for script execution time
3. **Test Dependency Chain**: Verify `runAfter` dependencies work correctly after script fix
4. **Document Hook Behavior**: Create clear documentation of what each hook does and when it runs

### For Long-Term Improvements

1. **Request IDE Logging**: Ask Kiro IDE team to add hook execution logging
2. **Create Hook Testing Framework**: Develop tools to test hooks in isolation
3. **Document Hook Development Best Practices**: Create guide for developing reliable hooks
4. **Add Hook Monitoring**: Consider creating dashboard or tool to monitor hook execution

### For Investigation Continuation

1. **Test Hook Triggering**: After script fix, verify hooks actually trigger on events
2. **Verify Dependency Chain**: Confirm release detection waits for file organization
3. **Test Timeout Behavior**: Verify what happens when hooks timeout
4. **Test Failure Handling**: Verify what happens when prerequisite hooks fail
