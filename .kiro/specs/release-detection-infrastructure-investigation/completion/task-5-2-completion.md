**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Task**: 5.2 Investigate hook dependency chain clarity
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- Updated `.kiro/specs/release-detection-infrastructure-investigation/investigation-notes.md` with Issue #004 investigation findings
- Documented `runAfter` dependency chain behavior
- Identified documentation gaps
- Assessed relationship to release detection failure

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Investigated Issue #004 (Release Manager Hook Dependency Chain Unclear) by:
1. Reading the issue description from phase-1-issues-registry.md
2. Analyzing both agent hook configurations (file organization and release detection)
3. Examining the `runAfter` dependency chain configuration
4. Identifying documentation gaps
5. Assessing whether dependency chain issues contribute to release detection failure

### Key Findings

**runAfter Configuration**:
- Release detection hook configured with `"runAfter": ["organize-after-task-completion"]`
- References the `id` field of the file organization hook
- Indicates sequential execution order: file organization first, then release detection
- Integration metadata explains rationale: "detect release triggers from organized completion documents"

**Timeout Configuration**:
- File organization: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- Release detection: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- Total potential execution time: 15 minutes if both run sequentially

**User Interaction**:
- File organization requires user confirmation (`requireConfirmation: true`)
- Release detection auto-approves (`autoApprove: true`)
- User interaction in file organization can block release detection

**Documentation Gaps Identified**:
1. No explanation of what `runAfter` means in Kiro IDE agent hooks
2. No documentation of behavior when dependent hook fails
3. No documentation of timeout interactions
4. No documentation of user cancellation effects
5. No logging or debugging guidance for dependency chains

**Relationship to Issue #001**:
- **Not the root cause** of release detection failure
- **Amplifies the impact** of the root cause by:
  - Creating two failure points instead of one
  - Adding user interaction that can block execution
  - Accumulating timeouts that reduce available execution time
  - Making debugging harder due to unclear dependency behavior

### How runAfter is Supposed to Work

Based on configuration analysis, `runAfter` appears to implement **sequential execution dependency**:

1. Both hooks listen for the same event (`taskStatusChange` with `status="completed"`)
2. File organization hook executes first (no `runAfter` dependency)
3. Release detection hook waits for file organization to complete
4. Release detection executes after file organization finishes

**Inferred Behavior** (not documented):
- If file organization completes successfully → Release detection runs
- If file organization is skipped by user → Release detection behavior unclear
- If file organization fails → Release detection behavior unclear
- If file organization times out → Release detection behavior unclear

**Rationale for Dependency**:
File organization may move completion documents to proper locations before release detection scans for them. Running release detection before organization could miss newly organized files.

### Documentation Gaps

**Missing Documentation**:
1. **runAfter Semantics**: No explanation of what `runAfter` means
   - Hard dependency (must complete successfully)?
   - Soft dependency (just execution order)?
   - What happens if dependent hook fails?

2. **Failure Handling**: No explanation of behavior when dependent hook fails
   - Does release detection run if organization fails?
   - Does release detection skip if organization is skipped?
   - Are there error logs or notifications?

3. **Timeout Behavior**: No explanation of timeout interactions
   - What happens if organization times out?
   - Does release detection still run after timeout?
   - Is there a total timeout for the dependency chain?

4. **User Cancellation**: No explanation of user interaction effects
   - If user cancels organization, does release detection run?
   - If user skips organization, does release detection run?
   - Can user cancel the entire dependency chain?

5. **Logging and Debugging**: No explanation of how to debug dependency chains
   - Where are hook execution logs?
   - How to verify dependency chain executed?
   - How to troubleshoot dependency issues?

### Assessment: Related to Release Detection Failure?

**Answer**: **Indirectly Related**

**Relationship Type**: **Amplifying Factor**, not Root Cause

**Explanation**:

The dependency chain itself is not causing release detection to fail. The root cause is that hooks aren't executing at all (likely event emission or hook registration issue from Investigation Area 2).

However, the dependency chain **amplifies the impact** by:
- Creating two failure points instead of one
- Adding user interaction that can block execution
- Accumulating timeouts that reduce available execution time
- Making debugging harder due to unclear dependency behavior

Even if the primary issue is fixed, the dependency chain could cause future problems due to unclear failure handling and timeout behavior.

### Recommendations

**Documentation Improvements**:
1. Add clear documentation explaining `runAfter` behavior
2. Document failure handling scenarios
3. Document timeout interactions
4. Add troubleshooting guide for dependency chains
5. Provide examples of dependency chain usage

**Configuration Improvements**:
1. Add logging for dependency chain execution
2. Make failure behavior explicit with configuration options
3. Improve timeout management
4. Consider making dependency optional or configurable

**Testing Improvements**:
1. Test dependency scenarios (success, failure, skip, timeout)
2. Add integration tests for complete dependency chains
3. Test user interaction effects on dependency chains

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ Investigation notes updated with proper markdown formatting
✅ All code examples properly formatted
✅ JSON configurations properly formatted

### Functional Validation
✅ Issue #004 reviewed and understood
✅ Hook configurations analyzed for `runAfter` behavior
✅ Documentation gaps identified
✅ Relationship to release detection failure assessed

### Integration Validation
✅ Findings integrated with Investigation Area 1 (release detection failure)
✅ Findings integrated with Investigation Area 2 (agent hook system)
✅ Cross-references to other investigation areas maintained

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 4.2: Reviewed Issue #004 (hook dependency chain unclear)
✅ Requirement 4.2: Determined if dependency chain issues contribute to release detection failure
✅ Requirement 4.2: Documented how `runAfter` is supposed to work
✅ Requirement 4.2: Identified documentation gaps
✅ Requirement 4.2: Assessed if this is related to release detection failure
✅ Requirement 4.2: Recorded findings in investigation notes

## Investigation Conclusion

**Issue #004 Assessment**:
- **Severity**: Minor (documentation gap, not functional issue)
- **Impact**: Makes debugging difficult, could cause future issues
- **Relationship to Issue #001**: Indirectly related (amplifies impact, not root cause)
- **Fix Priority**: Medium (document after fixing primary issue)

**Key Findings**:
1. ✅ runAfter configuration is properly set up
2. ✅ Integration metadata provides clear rationale
3. ❌ No documentation explaining `runAfter` behavior
4. ❌ Unclear failure handling for dependent hooks
5. ❌ No logging for dependency chain execution

**Conclusion**: The dependency chain is configured correctly but lacks documentation. It is not the root cause of release detection failure (Issue #001), but it amplifies the impact by creating additional failure points and making debugging more difficult. Documentation should be improved after the primary issue is fixed.
