**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Task**: 5.4 Document related issues analysis
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- Updated `.kiro/specs/release-detection-infrastructure-investigation/investigation-notes.md` with comprehensive related issues analysis
- Root cause analysis section added to investigation notes
- Fix grouping recommendations documented
- Test file cleanup decisions documented

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Synthesized findings from all related issues investigations (tasks 5.1, 5.2, 5.3) to:
1. Identify which issues share root causes
2. Identify which issues are independent
3. Assess relationships between issues
4. Recommend fix grouping strategies
5. Document test file cleanup decisions

### Issues Analyzed

**Issue #002**: commit-task.sh --help handling (Task 5.1)
**Issue #004**: Hook dependency chain unclear (Task 5.2)
**Issue #005**: File organization metadata validation (Task 5.3)
**Issue #006**: Cross-reference update logic issues (Task 5.3)
**Issue #007**: File organization scope limitation (Task 5.3)

### Root Cause Classification

#### Category 1: Agent Hook Event System Issues (Systemic)

**Issues**:
- Issue #001: Release detection hook not triggering (Investigation Area 1)
- Issue #003: Agent hook triggering cannot be verified (Investigation Area 2)

**Shared Root Cause**: Kiro IDE event system or agent hook integration failure

**Evidence**:
- Both issues involve hooks not executing at all
- Same failure mode: no evidence of hook execution
- Same system: Kiro IDE agent hook event handling
- Historical evidence shows hooks worked previously (October 22-28)
- Both issues discovered simultaneously

**Relationship**: **DIRECTLY RELATED** - Same root cause

**Fix Strategy**: Must be fixed together as they share the same underlying issue

---

#### Category 2: Script Implementation Issues (Independent)

**Issues**:
- Issue #002: commit-task.sh --help handling
- Issue #006: Cross-reference update logic issues

**Root Causes**: Individual script implementation bugs

**Evidence**:

**Issue #002**:
- Root Cause: Argument parsing logic doesn't recognize `--help` flag
- Failure Mode: Script executes but treats `--help` as task name
- System: commit-task.sh script
- Independence: Affects manual script invocation, not hook triggering

**Issue #006**:
- Root Cause: Cross-reference update logic has reliability concerns
- Failure Mode: Script executes but may have edge case failures
- System: organize-by-metadata.sh script
- Independence: Affects file organization, not release detection

**Relationship**: **INDEPENDENT** - Different scripts, different bugs, no shared root cause

**Fix Strategy**: Can be fixed separately or together based on convenience

---

#### Category 3: Documentation Gaps (Independent)

**Issues**:
- Issue #004: Hook dependency chain unclear
- Issue #007: File organization scope limitation

**Root Causes**: Missing or unclear documentation

**Evidence**:

**Issue #004**:
- Root Cause: No documentation explaining `runAfter` behavior
- Failure Mode: Unclear what happens when dependent hook fails
- System: Agent hook dependency chain
- Independence: Documentation gap, not functional issue

**Issue #007**:
- Root Cause: Intentional design decision not documented
- Failure Mode: Unclear why only root directory is scanned
- System: File organization scope
- Independence: Design decision, not implementation bug

**Relationship**: **INDEPENDENT** - Different systems, different documentation needs

**Fix Strategy**: Can be fixed separately as documentation updates

---

#### Category 4: Resolved Issues (No Action Needed)

**Issues**:
- Issue #005: File organization metadata validation inconsistency

**Status**: RESOLVED - No files currently use invalid metadata values

**Evidence**:
- Historical issue when BUILD-SYSTEM-SETUP.md used "process-documentation"
- File has since been corrected
- No current files use invalid metadata values
- Validation list is now sufficient

**Relationship**: **RESOLVED** - No fix needed

**Fix Strategy**: Document resolution in fix spec, no code changes required

---

### Shared Root Cause Analysis

**Question**: Which issues share root causes?

**Answer**: Only Issues #001 and #003 share a root cause

**Analysis Matrix**:

| Issue | System | Root Cause | Failure Mode | Shared With |
|-------|--------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| #001 | Agent hooks | Event system | No execution | #003 |
| #003 | Agent hooks | Event system | No verification | #001 |
| #002 | commit-task.sh | Argument parsing | Wrong execution | None |
| #004 | Documentation | Missing docs | Unclear behavior | None |
| #005 | File org | Historical gap | RESOLVED | None |
| #006 | organize script | Implementation | Reliability issues | None |
| #007 | Documentation | Design not documented | Unclear rationale | None |

**Key Finding**: Only 2 of 7 issues share a root cause (Issues #001 and #003)

**Implications**:
- Most issues are independent and can be fixed separately
- Agent hook issues must be fixed together
- Other issues can be prioritized independently
- Fix complexity varies significantly between issues

---

### Independence Analysis

**Question**: Which issues are independent?

**Answer**: Issues #002, #004, #005, #006, #007 are all independent

**Evidence for Independence**:

**Issue #002 (commit-task.sh --help)**:
- Different system: Manual script invocation
- Different failure mode: Script executes incorrectly
- No dependency: Works regardless of hook system status
- Can be fixed: Without affecting any other issue

**Issue #004 (Hook dependency chain)**:
- Different system: Documentation
- Different failure mode: Unclear behavior, not broken functionality
- No dependency: Doesn't affect whether hooks execute
- Can be fixed: With documentation updates only

**Issue #005 (Metadata validation)**:
- Status: Already resolved
- No dependency: Doesn't affect any other system
- No action needed: Just document resolution

**Issue #006 (Cross-reference logic)**:
- Different system: File organization script
- Different failure mode: Potential reliability issues
- No dependency: Doesn't affect release detection
- Can be fixed: Without affecting hook system

**Issue #007 (Scope limitation)**:
- Different system: File organization design
- Different failure mode: Intentional design, not a bug
- No dependency: Doesn't affect release detection
- Can be fixed: With documentation explaining rationale

**Cross-System Analysis**:

```
Agent Hook System (Systemic)
├── Issue #001: Release detection not triggering
└── Issue #003: Hook triggering cannot be verified
    └── Shared Root Cause: Event system failure

Script Implementation (Independent)
├── Issue #002: commit-task.sh argument parsing
└── Issue #006: organize-by-metadata.sh reliability
    └── No Shared Root Cause: Different scripts, different bugs

Documentation (Independent)
├── Issue #004: runAfter behavior unclear
└── Issue #007: Scope limitation not documented
    └── No Shared Root Cause: Different systems, different docs

Resolved (No Action)
└── Issue #005: Metadata validation
    └── Already fixed
```

**Conclusion**: 5 of 7 issues are independent and can be fixed separately

### Fix Grouping Recommendations

**Recommended Fix Strategy**: Three-tier priority system with grouped fixes

#### Priority 1: Agent Hook System Issues (CRITICAL)

**Issues to Fix Together**:
- Issue #001: Release detection hook not triggering
- Issue #003: Agent hook triggering cannot be verified

**Rationale for Grouping**:
- Same root cause (agent hook event system)
- Same failure mode (no hook execution)
- Must be diagnosed together
- Fix will address both simultaneously

**Fix Approach**:
1. Investigate Kiro IDE event emission
2. Verify hook registration with Kiro IDE
3. Test event flow from taskStatus to hook execution
4. Fix npm script syntax in release-manager.sh (line 117)
5. Add logging for hook execution verification

**Complexity**: Moderate to High
- May require Kiro IDE investigation
- May require Kiro team assistance
- Script bug fix is simple (npm syntax)
- Event system diagnosis is complex

**Priority**: CRITICAL - Blocks all automation

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
- 1 day: Kiro IDE investigation
- 1 day: Fix implementation
- 0.5 day: Testing and verification

---

#### Priority 2: File Organization Issues (IMPORTANT)

**Issues to Fix Together**:
- Issue #006: Cross-reference update logic issues
- Issue #007: Scope limitation documentation

**Rationale for Grouping**:
- Same file (`.kiro/hooks/organize-by-metadata.sh`)
- Same system (file organization)
- Can test together
- Single PR/commit

**Fix Approach**:

**Issue #006**:
1. Add Python availability check before use
2. Improve fallback path calculation
3. Add link validation after updates
4. Verify backup files before deletion

**Issue #007**:
1. Document intentional design decision
2. Explain why root-only scanning is appropriate
3. Add option for recursive scanning (optional)
4. Update README with scope explanation

**Complexity**: Low to Moderate
- Script improvements are straightforward
- Documentation is simple
- Testing is manageable

**Priority**: IMPORTANT - Reduces reliability

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days
- 0.5 day: Script improvements
- 0.5 day: Documentation
- 0.5 day: Testing

**Rationale for Separate Fixes**:
- Different files and systems
- Different complexity levels
- No dependencies between them
- Can be prioritized independently

**Fix Approach**:

**Issue #002** (commit-task.sh):
1. Add `--help` and `-h` cases to argument parsing
2. Display usage information
3. Exit without creating commit
4. Test with various flag combinations

**Issue #004** (Documentation):
1. Document `runAfter` behavior
2. Explain failure handling scenarios
3. Add troubleshooting guide
4. Provide examples

**Issue #005** (RESOLVED):
1. Document that issue is resolved
2. Note historical context
3. No code changes needed

**Complexity**: Low
- Simple script changes
- Documentation updates
- No complex testing

**Priority**: MINOR - Usability improvements

**Estimated Effort**: 0.5-1 day per issue
- Issue #002: 0.5 day
- Issue #004: 0.5 day
- Issue #005: 0.25 day (documentation only)
