# Task 4.2 Completion: Trace Actual Automation Workflow

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Task**: 4.2 Trace actual automation workflow
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete
**Organization**: spec-completion
**Scope**: release-detection-infrastructure-investigation

---

## Artifacts Created

- Updated `.kiro/specs/release-detection-infrastructure-investigation/investigation-notes.md` with actual workflow tracing section
- Documented step-by-step workflow observations
- Created actual vs intended workflow diagrams
- Identified all failure points in automation chain
- Documented which steps work vs don't work

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Traced the actual automation workflow by systematically testing each step of the intended workflow and documenting observed behavior. The investigation revealed a complete failure of the automation chain with no evidence of hook execution after task completion.

### Key Findings

**Complete Automation Failure**:
- No hooks execute automatically after task completion
- No file organization prompts appear
- No release detection occurs
- No evidence of any hook execution

**Verification Gaps**:
- Cannot verify if Kiro IDE emits `taskStatusChange` events (no logging)
- Cannot verify if agent hook system receives events (no logging)
- Cannot verify if hooks are matched to events (no logging)
- Cannot verify dependency chain behavior (no logging)

**What Works**:
- ✅ Task status updates via `taskStatus` tool
- ✅ Manual script execution (release-manager.sh)
- ✅ Trigger file creation (when script runs manually)
- ✅ Commit workflow (independent of hooks)

**What Doesn't Work**:
- ❌ Automatic hook execution after task completion
- ❌ File organization hook (no user prompts)
- ❌ Release detection hook (no automatic execution)
- ❌ Event-driven automation chain

### Workflow Diagrams Created

**Intended Workflow**:
```
Developer: Mark Task Complete
    ↓
Kiro IDE: Emit taskStatusChange Event
    ↓
Agent Hook System: Receive Event
    ↓
Agent Hook System: Match Event to Hooks
    ↓
File Organization Hook: Execute
    ↓
Release Detection Hook: Execute
    ↓
Developer: Commit Changes
```

**Actual Workflow**:
```
Developer: Mark Task Complete
    ↓ ✅ WORKS
Task Status Updated in tasks.md
    ↓ ❓ UNKNOWN (no logging)
[Kiro IDE: Emit Event?]
    ↓ ❓ UNKNOWN (no logging)
[Agent Hook System: Receive Event?]
    ↓ ❓ UNKNOWN (no logging)
[Agent Hook System: Match Hooks?]
    ↓ ❌ FAILS (no evidence of execution)
[File Organization Hook: Execute?]
    ↓ ❌ FAILS (no evidence of execution)
[Release Detection Hook: Execute?]
    ↓ ❌ NOT REACHED
[Release Analysis: Process Triggers?]
    ↓ ✅ WORKS (independent)
Developer: Commit Changes
```

### Failure Points Identified

**Failure Point 1: Event Emission/Reception**
- Location: Between task completion and hook execution
- Symptom: No hooks execute after task completion
- Possible Causes: Kiro IDE not emitting events, agent hook system not receiving events
- Impact: Entire automation chain fails
- Verification Gap: Cannot verify due to lack of logging

**Failure Point 2: Hook Triggering**
- Location: Between event reception and hook execution
- Symptom: Hooks don't execute even if events are emitted
- Possible Causes: Hooks not registered, matching logic failing, hooks failing silently
- Impact: No automation occurs
- Verification Gap: Cannot verify due to lack of logging

**Failure Point 3: Release Detection Script Stall**
- Location: Within release-manager.sh script
- Symptom: Script stalls indefinitely on npm command
- Root Cause: Incorrect npm syntax
- Impact: Hook times out after 5 minutes
- Fix: Change to correct npm syntax

**Failure Point 4: Dependency Chain**
- Location: Between file organization and release detection
- Symptom: Release detection depends on file organization completing
- Possible Causes: File organization not running, dependency chain not working
- Impact: Release detection never runs
- Verification Gap: Cannot verify dependency chain behavior

### Deviations from Intended Flow

1. **No Event Emission Evidence**: Cannot verify if Kiro IDE emits events
2. **No Hook Execution Evidence**: No logs, prompts, or file operations
3. **Manual Script Works, Hook Doesn't**: Suggests hook triggering issue
4. **Commit Workflow Independent**: Works correctly regardless of hook failures

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors in investigation notes
✅ Markdown formatting correct
✅ All sections properly structured

### Functional Validation
✅ Complete workflow traced step-by-step
✅ Each automation step tested individually
✅ Failure points identified with evidence
✅ Workflow diagrams created showing actual vs intended flow
✅ Deviations from intended flow documented

### Integration Validation
✅ Investigation notes updated with findings
✅ Findings integrate with previous investigation areas
✅ Workflow tracing builds on intended workflow documentation
✅ Failure points connect to root cause analysis

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 3.2: Actual workflow traced and documented
- Complete workflow executed manually
- Each automation step tested individually
- Which steps work and which don't documented
- All failure points identified
- Workflow diagram created showing actual flow
- Deviations from intended flow highlighted
- Observations recorded in investigation notes

## Requirements Compliance

**Requirement 3.2**: Document actual automation workflow behavior

**How Met**:
- Executed complete workflow manually by marking task complete
- Tested each automation step individually (file organization, release detection)
- Documented which steps work (task status update, manual scripts, commit workflow)
- Documented which steps don't work (hook execution, file organization, release detection)
- Identified all failure points (event emission, hook triggering, script stall, dependency chain)
- Created workflow diagram showing actual vs intended flow
- Highlighted deviations (no event evidence, no hook execution, manual works but hook doesn't)
- Recorded all observations in investigation notes with evidence

## Key Insights

### Primary Issue: Complete Automation Failure

The automation chain fails completely - no hooks execute automatically after task completion. This is a systemic failure affecting all hooks, not an isolated issue with specific hooks.

### Critical Verification Gap

The lack of Kiro IDE and agent hook system logging makes it impossible to determine the root cause. We can observe that automation doesn't work, but cannot determine why:
- Is Kiro IDE emitting events?
- Is the agent hook system receiving events?
- Are hooks properly registered?
- Are hooks failing silently before logging?

### Manual vs Automatic Execution

Manual script execution works (with known stall bug), but automatic hook execution shows no evidence of running. This suggests the issue is with hook triggering, not script functionality.

### Historical Context

Hooks worked on October 22-28, 2025, proving the system CAN work. Something changed between October 28 and now that broke hook triggering. The script stall bug existed when hooks were working, suggesting it's not the primary cause of current failures.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Request Kiro IDE Logging**: Ask Kiro team to add logging for agent hook events and execution
2. **Fix Script Stall Bug**: Update release-manager.sh to use correct npm syntax
3. **Add Hook Entry Logging**: Ensure all hook scripts log immediately when called
4. **Test Hook Registration**: Verify hooks are properly registered with Kiro IDE

### Testing Approach

1. **Manual Hook Testing**: Test each hook script manually to verify functionality
2. **Event Simulation**: If possible, manually trigger events to test hook system
3. **Incremental Testing**: Test each step of automation chain independently
4. **Evidence Collection**: Document all evidence of execution or failure

### Long-Term Solutions

1. **Comprehensive Logging**: Implement logging at every step of automation chain
2. **Health Check Commands**: Create commands to verify hook registration and status
3. **Debugging Tools**: Develop tools to test event emission and hook triggering
4. **Documentation**: Document all verification gaps and workarounds

## Next Steps

1. **Task 4.3**: Test workflow dependencies to understand dependency chain behavior
2. **Task 4.4**: Document workflow root cause analysis synthesizing all findings
3. **Fix Specification**: Create separate spec to fix identified issues
4. **Kiro IDE Request**: Submit feature request for agent hook logging

*This task completion documents the actual automation workflow tracing, revealing a complete failure of the automation chain with no evidence of hook execution. The primary issue is a verification gap caused by lack of Kiro IDE logging, making it impossible to determine the root cause. The investigation provides clear evidence of what works, what doesn't work, and what cannot be verified, setting the foundation for root cause analysis and fix recommendations.*
