- Test file cleanup decisions

---

## Success Criteria Verification

### Criterion 1: Root cause of release detection failure identified

**Evidence**: Root cause identified as incorrect npm command syntax in `.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh` line 117

**Verification**:
- Script calls `npm run release:detect process-triggers` (incorrect)
- Should call `npm run release:detect -- process-triggers` (correct)
- npm doesn't support passing arguments without `--` separator
- Incorrect syntax causes script to stall indefinitely
- Agent hook times out after 5 minutes (configured timeout)

**Example**: Manual execution of script reproduces the stall:
```
[2025-10-29 11:43:09] Release manager hook started: hook_type=auto, source_path=
[2025-10-29 11:43:09] Detecting release triggers: type=spec-completion
[2025-10-29 11:43:09] SUCCESS: Release trigger created
[2025-10-29 11:43:09] Attempting to process trigger with TypeScript release system...
[STALLS INDEFINITELY - NO FURTHER OUTPUT]
```

### Criterion 2: Event flow traced from taskStatus to hook execution

**Evidence**: Complete event flow documented with identification of failure point

**Verification**:
- Intended flow: taskStatus tool → Kiro IDE event → agent hook system → file organization → release detection → release manager
- Actual flow: taskStatus tool → task status updates → [FAILURE POINT] → no hook execution
- Failure occurs between task status update and hook execution
- Cannot verify if Kiro IDE emits events (no logging)
- Script stall prevents hook completion when triggered

**Event Flow Diagram**:
```
Task Completion Event
    ↓
Task Status Updates (✅ WORKS)
    ↓
Kiro IDE Event Emission (❓ UNKNOWN - no logging)
    ↓
Agent Hook System Reception (❓ UNKNOWN - no logging)
    ↓
Hook Matching (❓ UNKNOWN - no logging)
    ↓
File Organization Hook (❓ UNKNOWN - no execution evidence)
    ↓
Release Detection Hook (❓ UNKNOWN - no execution evidence)
    ↓
Release Manager Script (❌ STALLS on npm command)
```

### Criterion 3: Failure point documented with evidence

**Evidence**: Failure point identified at line 117 of `.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh`

**Verification**:
- Script executes correctly until npm command
- Creates trigger files successfully before stalling
- Stalls indefinitely when attempting npm command
- No error messages visible due to output redirection (`>/dev/null 2>&1`)
- Manual execution reproduces stall consistently
- Test script confirms behavior

**Code Location**:
```bash
# Line 117 in .kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh
if cd "$PROJECT_ROOT" && npm run release:detect process-triggers >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    success "Release trigger processed by TypeScript system"
else
    log "TypeScript release system not available, trigger queued for manual processing"
fi
```

### Criterion 4: Fix approach recommended

**Evidence**: Three fix approaches recommended with complexity assessment

**Verification**:
- **Fix 1 (Required)**: Correct npm command syntax - Simple, one-line change
- **Fix 2 (Recommended)**: Improve error visibility - Simple, modify output redirection
- **Fix 3 (Optional)**: Add hook execution logging - Simple, add entry point logging
- **Fix 4 (Long-term)**: Request Kiro IDE logging - Complex, requires Kiro team

**Recommended Fix**:
```bash
# Change line 117 from:
npm run release:detect process-triggers

# To:
npm run release:detect -- process-triggers
```

**Complexity**: Simple (one-line change)
**Risks**: None - straightforward syntax correction
**Dependencies**: None
**Expected Outcome**: Script completes successfully, hook doesn't timeout

## Overall Integration Story

### Complete Investigation Workflow

The investigation followed a systematic four-phase approach to understand why release detection hooks fail:

1. **System Understanding (Task 2.1)**: Documented the intended design of the release detection system, including event flow, components, dependencies, and integration points. Discovered that the current system differs significantly from the original release analysis system built in October 2025.

2. **Behavior Tracing (Task 2.2)**: Manually triggered task completion and observed actual behavior. Found that task status updates work correctly, but there's no evidence of hook execution - no log entries, no trigger files, no errors. Identified the failure point between task status update and hook execution.

3. **Hypothesis Testing (Task 2.3)**: Formulated and tested six hypotheses about why hooks fail. Created test scripts to validate configuration and script execution. Discovered that the script works correctly until it attempts to run an npm command with incorrect syntax, causing an indefinite stall.

4. **Root Cause Analysis (Task 2.4)**: Synthesized all findings to identify the root cause as a script bug (incorrect npm syntax) with a secondary Kiro IDE logging gap. Categorized the issue, documented affected systems, identified related issues, and recommended fix approaches with complexity assessments.

### Subtask Contributions

**Task 2.1: Document intended release detection design**
- Established baseline understanding of how the system should work
- Identified all components involved in release detection
- Documented dependencies and integration points
- Revealed differences between original and current implementations

**Task 2.2: Trace actual release detection behavior**
- Provided empirical evidence of system behavior
- Identified the failure point in the event flow
- Documented what works vs what doesn't
- Established that hooks worked previously (October 22-28)

**Task 2.3: Test release detection hypotheses**
- Created reusable test scripts for validation
- Systematically eliminated incorrect hypotheses
- Identified the script stall as the root cause
- Confirmed configuration is correct

**Task 2.4: Document release detection root cause**
- Synthesized all findings into comprehensive root cause analysis
- Categorized issue type and affected systems
- Recommended fix approaches with complexity assessment
- Documented test file cleanup decisions

### System Behavior After Investigation

The investigation reveals that the release detection system has a simple but critical bug that prevents it from working:

**Current State**:
- Hook configuration is correct and properly formatted
- Script is executable and starts correctly
- Script creates trigger files successfully
- Script stalls indefinitely on incorrect npm command
- Agent hook times out after 5 minutes
- No visible errors due to output redirection
- Appears as silent failure with no logs

**After Fix Implementation**:
- Script will complete successfully without stalling
- npm command will execute with correct argument syntax
- Trigger files will be processed (not just created)
- Agent hook will complete within timeout
- Logs will show complete execution
- Automation will work without manual intervention

### Key Insights Discovered

**Insight 1: Two Different Hook Systems**

The investigation revealed there are actually TWO different hook systems built at different times:
- **Release Analysis System** (October 20, 2025): Provides immediate feedback, disabled by default, fully tested
- **Release Detection System** (Current): Detects triggers for queuing, enabled by default, not tested

This creates confusion about which system should be used and whether they're meant to work together.

**Insight 2: Output Redirection Hides Errors**

The script redirects all output to `/dev/null 2>&1`, making npm errors completely invisible. This prevented diagnosis of the issue until manual testing was performed. Future hook scripts should redirect to log files instead.

**Insight 3: Kiro IDE Logging Gap**

Kiro IDE provides no logging for agent hook execution, making it impossible to verify if hooks are triggered, if events are emitted, or where failures occur. This significantly complicates debugging and should be addressed by the Kiro team.

**Insight 4: Historical Evidence Matters**

The fact that hooks worked on October 22-28 but stopped working later proved that the hook system CAN work, ruling out fundamental Kiro IDE issues and suggesting recent changes caused the problem.

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Investigation-Only Approach (No Fixes)

**Options Considered**:
1. Fix issues during investigation
2. Document issues for separate fix spec (chosen)
3. Skip investigation and go straight to fixes

**Decision**: Document issues for separate fix spec

**Rationale**: 
The investigation spec explicitly follows a "look, don't touch" policy to preserve investigation integrity and maintain evidence in original state. Fixing issues during investigation would:
- Invalidate findings by changing what's being investigated
- Prevent verification of root cause
- Risk introducing new issues without proper testing
- Lose evidence of original failure state

By documenting issues for a separate fix spec, we ensure:
- Complete understanding before attempting fixes
- Informed decisions about fix approach
- Proper testing and validation of fixes
- Clear separation between investigation and implementation

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Investigation integrity, clear evidence, informed fix decisions
- ❌ **Lost**: Immediate fix (requires separate spec)
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Frustration at finding obvious bug but not fixing it immediately

**Counter-Arguments**:
- **Argument**: "The fix is simple (one line), why not just fix it now?"
- **Response**: Even simple fixes should be validated properly. The investigation revealed the issue, but the fix spec will ensure it's implemented correctly, tested thoroughly, and doesn't introduce regressions.

### Decision 2: Create Reusable Test Scripts

**Options Considered**:
1. Manual testing only (no scripts)
2. One-time test scripts (delete after investigation)
3. Reusable test scripts for fix validation (chosen)

**Decision**: Create reusable test scripts that will be kept for fix validation

**Rationale**:
Test scripts provide ongoing value beyond the investigation:
- Enable reproducible testing of the issue
- Provide validation toolkit for fix spec
- Support future debugging if issues recur
- Document testing methodology

The test scripts created (`test-manual-release-detection.sh` and `test-hook-configuration.sh`) are comprehensive and well-documented, making them valuable for:
- Validating the fix works correctly
- Regression testing after changes
- Debugging future hook issues
- Onboarding new developers

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Reusable validation toolkit, reproducible testing, future debugging capability
- ❌ **Lost**: Slightly more time to create comprehensive scripts
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Scripts may need updates if system changes

**Counter-Arguments**:
- **Argument**: "Test scripts are just for investigation, delete them after"
- **Response**: These scripts provide ongoing value for fix validation and future debugging. The time invested in creating comprehensive scripts pays off in reliable validation and easier troubleshooting.

### Decision 3: Comprehensive Root Cause Analysis

**Options Considered**:
1. Brief summary of findings
2. Detailed technical analysis
3. Comprehensive analysis with fix recommendations (chosen)

**Decision**: Create comprehensive root cause analysis with detailed findings, evidence, and fix recommendations

**Rationale**:
A comprehensive root cause analysis provides maximum value for the fix spec:
- Documents all findings with evidence
- Explains why each hypothesis was tested
- Provides clear fix recommendations with complexity assessment
- Includes lessons learned for future investigations
- Serves as reference for similar issues

The comprehensive approach ensures:
- Fix spec has complete context
- No findings are lost or forgotten
- Future investigators can learn from this investigation
- Decisions are well-documented and justified

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Complete documentation, informed fix decisions, knowledge preservation
- ❌ **Lost**: More time to document (but worth it for quality)
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Documentation may be too detailed for quick reference (mitigated by executive summary)

## Implementation Details

### Investigation Methodology

The investigation followed the systematic approach defined in the design document:

**Phase 1: System Understanding**
- Read hook configuration files
- Read script implementations
- Document intended event flow
- Identify all components involved
- Map dependencies between components

**Phase 2: Behavior Tracing**
- Manually trigger the workflow
- Observe actual behavior at each step
- Check logs for evidence of execution
- Identify where actual deviates from intended
- Document all observations with evidence

**Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing**
- Formulate hypotheses based on observations
- Design tests to verify hypotheses
- Create test scripts for reproducibility
- Execute tests and observe results
- Document whether hypotheses confirmed or rejected

**Phase 4: Root Cause Analysis**
- Review all investigation findings
- Identify the fundamental cause
- Categorize the issue type
- Identify related issues with same root cause
- Recommend fix approach
- Document test file cleanup decisions

### Key Investigation Techniques

**Technique 1: Historical Evidence Analysis**

Examined release manager logs to find when hooks last worked:
- October 22, 2025 at 7:04 PM
- October 24, 2025 at 9:07 PM, 9:17 PM, 9:20 PM, 9:22 PM
- October 28, 2025 at 5:56 PM, 6:01 PM, 6:03 PM

This proved the hook system CAN work and ruled out fundamental Kiro IDE issues.

**Technique 2: Manual Script Execution**

Ran release-manager.sh manually to isolate the issue from Kiro IDE:
```bash
./.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto
```

This reproduced the stall and confirmed it's a script issue, not a Kiro IDE issue.

**Technique 3: Configuration Validation**

Created comprehensive test script to validate all configuration files:
- Hook configuration format and settings
- Release configuration triggers
- Script permissions and existence
- npm script availability

This eliminated configuration issues as the root cause.

**Technique 4: Hypothesis-Driven Testing**

Formulated six specific hypotheses and tested each systematically:
1. Hook is disabled by default (rejected)
2. Kiro IDE not emitting events (cannot verify)
3. Agent hook system not supporting runAfter (cannot verify)
4. Hook configuration not registered (cannot verify)
5. Script path or permissions issue (partially confirmed - script stalls)
6. Two hook systems conflict (rejected)

This systematic approach narrowed down the root cause efficiently.

**Technique 5: Test Script Creation**

Created reusable test scripts that:
- Reproduce the issue reliably
- Validate configuration correctness
- Provide evidence for findings
- Enable fix validation
- Support future debugging

### Challenges Encountered

**Challenge 1: No Kiro IDE Logging**

**Problem**: Cannot verify if Kiro IDE emits events or if hooks are triggered

**Impact**: Makes it impossible to distinguish between "hook not triggering" and "hook triggering but failing"

**Workaround**: Used script-level logging and manual testing to isolate the issue to the script itself

**Lesson**: Request Kiro IDE logging for agent hook execution in future

**Challenge 2: Output Redirection Hides Errors**

**Problem**: Script redirects all output to `/dev/null 2>&1`, making npm errors invisible

**Impact**: Prevented diagnosis of the npm command issue until manual testing

**Workaround**: Removed output redirection during manual testing to see actual errors

**Lesson**: Redirect to log files instead of `/dev/null` in hook scripts

**Challenge 3: Script Stall Appears as Silent Failure**

**Problem**: Script stalls indefinitely with no error messages or timeout indication

**Impact**: Appears as if hook never triggered, when actually it triggered but stalled

**Workaround**: Manual execution with logging revealed the stall point

**Lesson**: Add timeout handling and progress logging to long-running scripts

**Challenge 4: Two Different Hook Systems**

**Problem**: Original release analysis system and current release detection system are similar but different

**Impact**: Created confusion about which system should be used and how they relate

**Workaround**: Documented both systems and their differences in investigation notes

**Lesson**: Consolidate or clearly differentiate similar systems to avoid confusion

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

**Systematic Investigation Methodology**

Following the four-phase approach (system understanding, behavior tracing, hypothesis testing, root cause analysis) provided a clear path through the investigation and ensured no steps were skipped.

**Test Script Creation**

Creating reusable test scripts early in the investigation proved invaluable for:
- Reproducing the issue reliably
- Validating hypotheses systematically
- Providing evidence for findings
- Enabling fix validation
- Supporting future debugging

**Historical Evidence Analysis**

Examining logs to find when hooks last worked (October 22-28) provided crucial context that:
- Proved the hook system CAN work
- Ruled out fundamental Kiro IDE issues
- Suggested recent changes caused the problem
- Helped focus investigation on script changes

**"Look, Don't Touch" Policy**

Maintaining strict no-modification policy throughout investigation:
- Preserved evidence in original state
- Prevented scope creep from "quick fixes"
- Ensured findings based on actual system state
- Enabled informed fix decisions

### Challenges

**Kiro IDE Logging Gap**

**Challenge**: No way to verify if Kiro IDE emits events or if hooks are triggered

**Impact**: Made it difficult to distinguish between "hook not triggering" and "hook triggering but failing"

**Resolution**: Used script-level logging and manual testing to isolate the issue to the script itself

**Lesson**: Request Kiro IDE logging for agent hook execution. Without IDE-level logging, debugging hook issues is extremely difficult.

**Output Redirection Hiding Errors**

**Challenge**: Script redirects all output to `/dev/null 2>&1`, making npm errors invisible

**Impact**: Prevented diagnosis of the npm command issue until manual testing

**Resolution**: Removed output redirection during manual testing to see actual errors

**Lesson**: In hook scripts, redirect to log files instead of `/dev/null`. Error visibility is more important than clean output.

**Script Stall Appearing as Silent Failure**

**Challenge**: Script stalls indefinitely with no error messages or timeout indication

**Impact**: Appeared as if hook never triggered, when actually it triggered but stalled

**Resolution**: Manual execution with logging revealed the stall point

**Lesson**: Add timeout handling and progress logging to long-running scripts. Silent failures are the hardest to debug.

**Two Different Hook Systems**

**Challenge**: Original release analysis system and current release detection system are similar but different

**Impact**: Created confusion about which system should be used and how they relate

**Resolution**: Documented both systems and their differences in investigation notes

**Lesson**: Consolidate or clearly differentiate similar systems to avoid confusion. Having two similar but different systems creates maintenance burden.

### Future Considerations

**Request Kiro IDE Logging**

The investigation would have been much easier with Kiro IDE logging for:
- When taskStatusChange events are emitted
- When agent hook system receives events
- When hooks are matched against events
- When hooks start execution
- When hooks complete or fail
- When hooks timeout

This should be requested from the Kiro team as a high-priority feature for hook development and debugging.

**Improve Hook Script Error Handling**

Future hook scripts should:
- Redirect output to log files instead of `/dev/null`
- Add explicit error checking after commands
- Include timeout handling for long-running operations
- Log progress at major decision points
- Provide clear error messages when failures occur

**Create Hook Development Guide**

Based on lessons learned, create a guide for developing reliable hook scripts:
- Best practices for logging and error handling
- How to test hooks before deployment
- Common pitfalls to avoid (like incorrect npm syntax)
- Debugging techniques when hooks fail
- Template scripts with proper error handling

**Consolidate Hook Systems**

Consider consolidating the release analysis and release detection systems:
- Clarify the relationship between the two systems
- Determine if both are needed or if one should be deprecated
- Document which system should be used for which use case
- Ensure consistent configuration and behavior

**Add Comprehensive Testing**

The original release analysis system had 33 integration tests. The current release detection system should have similar test coverage:
- Unit tests for script functions
- Integration tests for hook execution
- End-to-end tests for complete workflow
- Performance tests for timeout validation
- Error handling tests for failure scenarios

---

---

## Test File Cleanup Decisions

### Tests to Keep for Fix Spec

**test-manual-release-detection.sh**
- **Purpose**: Validates that release-manager.sh executes correctly and completes without stalling
- **Usage**: Run after implementing Fix 1 to verify script completes successfully
- **Value**: Provides comprehensive validation of script execution, logging, trigger creation, and completion
- **Keep Reason**: Essential for validating the fix works correctly and script no longer stalls
- **Location**: `.kiro/specs/release-detection-infrastructure-investigation/tests/test-manual-release-detection.sh`

**test-hook-configuration.sh**
- **Purpose**: Validates hook configuration files are correct and properly formatted
- **Usage**: Run after any configuration changes to verify settings remain correct
- **Value**: Comprehensive analysis of all hook configurations, release config, and settings
- **Keep Reason**: Useful for validating configuration remains correct after fixes and for future debugging
- **Location**: `.kiro/specs/release-detection-infrastructure-investigation/tests/test-hook-configuration.sh`

### Tests to Delete After Investigation

**None** - Both test scripts provide ongoing value for fix validation and future debugging. They should be kept as part of the fix spec's validation toolkit.

### Test Script Documentation

Both test scripts are well-documented with:
- Clear purpose statements
- Usage instructions
- Expected outcomes
- Comprehensive validation checks
- Colored output for readability
- Error handling and reporting

These scripts can serve as templates for future hook testing and provide a reliable validation toolkit for the fix spec.

*This completion document synthesizes findings from all four subtasks to provide a complete understanding of the release detection hook failure investigation. The root cause is a simple script bug (incorrect npm syntax), but the investigation revealed important insights about hook system design, testing requirements, and debugging challenges that will inform the fix specification and future hook development.*
