## Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Three-Tier Priority System for Fix Grouping

**Options Considered**:
1. Fix all issues together in single effort
2. Fix all issues separately and independently
3. Fix by system (hooks, scripts, documentation)
4. Three-tier priority system based on root cause and impact (chosen)

**Decision**: Three-tier priority system

**Rationale**:

The three-tier approach optimally balances several competing concerns:

**Priority 1 (CRITICAL)** groups agent hook issues (#001, #003) because they share the same root cause (Kiro IDE event system failure) and must be diagnosed together. Fixing them separately would duplicate investigation effort and risk missing the systemic issue.

**Priority 2 (IMPORTANT)** groups file organization issues (#006, #007) because they affect the same file (organize-by-metadata.sh) and can be tested together efficiently. This grouping provides practical implementation benefits without blocking critical fixes.

**Priority 3 (MINOR)** separates other issues (#002, #004, #005) because they affect different systems, have different complexity levels, and can be prioritized independently based on available resources.

This approach enables:
- Parallel work on P2 and P3 while P1 is being fixed
- Clear priority order based on impact
- Efficient resource allocation
- Incremental improvements
- Flexible scheduling

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Clear priorities, efficient grouping, parallel work possible, incremental delivery
- ❌ **Lost**: Some coordination overhead between priority tiers
- ⚠️ **Risk**: P2 and P3 fixes might need adjustment after P1 is complete

**Counter-Arguments**:
- **Argument**: "Fix all together" would be more comprehensive
- **Response**: Too risky and blocks all progress until complete. The issues are mostly independent and don't benefit from simultaneous fixing.

- **Argument**: "Fix all separately" would be more flexible
- **Response**: Misses optimization opportunities for shared root causes (#001, #003) and same-file changes (#006, #007).

---

### Decision 2: Keep All Test Files for Fix Spec

**Options Considered**:
1. Delete all test files after investigation
2. Keep only tests that validate fixes
3. Keep all test files (chosen)

**Decision**: Keep all 3 test files

**Rationale**:

All test files created during investigation provide validation value for the fix specification:

**test-hook-configuration.sh**:
- Validates hook configuration correctness
- Checks for conflicting hooks
- Verifies release configuration settings
- Useful for regression testing after agent hook fixes

**test-manual-release-detection.sh**:
- Validates release-manager.sh script execution
- Tests trigger file creation
- Identifies npm command stall bug
- Critical for verifying script fixes work correctly

**test-file-organization.sh**:
- Validates file organization issues
- Confirms independence from release detection
- Tests metadata validation, cross-reference logic, and scope limitation
- Useful for verifying file organization fixes

The maintenance burden is minimal (3 files) and the validation value is high. Each test documents evidence of issues and provides regression testing capability.

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Comprehensive validation, regression testing, documented evidence
- ❌ **Lost**: Minimal - slight increase in test directory size
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Tests might need updates if implementation changes significantly

**Counter-Arguments**:
- **Argument**: "Delete one-time hypothesis tests to reduce clutter"
- **Response**: These aren't hypothesis tests - they're validation tests that verify specific issues and can be reused for regression testing.

## Implementation Details

### Overall Approach

Investigated 5 related infrastructure issues (Issues #002, #004, #005, #006, #007) through 4 systematic subtasks:

1. **Task 5.1**: Investigated commit-task.sh --help handling
2. **Task 5.2**: Investigated hook dependency chain clarity
3. **Task 5.3**: Investigated file organization issues (3 issues)
4. **Task 5.4**: Synthesized findings and created fix grouping recommendations

Each investigation followed the systematic approach defined in the design document:
- Understand intended behavior
- Trace actual behavior
- Identify root causes
- Assess relationships to other issues
- Recommend fix approaches

### Key Patterns Discovered

**Pattern 1: Most Issues Are Independent**

Only 2 of 7 total issues share a root cause:
- Issue #001 (Release detection not triggering) and Issue #003 (Hook triggering cannot be verified) share the same root cause: Kiro IDE agent hook event system failure

The remaining 5 issues are independent:
- Issue #002: Script argument parsing bug (commit-task.sh)
- Issue #004: Documentation gap (runAfter behavior)
- Issue #005: Historical issue (RESOLVED)
- Issue #006: Script reliability concerns (organize-by-metadata.sh)
- Issue #007: Design decision not documented (scope limitation)

This independence means most issues can be fixed separately without coordination, enabling parallel work and flexible prioritization.

**Pattern 2: File Organization Issues Don't Affect Release Detection**

All three file organization issues (#005, #006, #007) have **ZERO impact** on release detection:

- Completion documents are in subdirectories (`.kiro/specs/*/completion/`)
- File organization scans root directory only
- No overlap - file organization doesn't touch completion documents
- Release detection doesn't use metadata validation
- Release detection doesn't follow cross-references
- Systems operate independently

This independence means file organization fixes can proceed without blocking or being blocked by release detection fixes.

**Pattern 3: Different Issue Categories Require Different Fix Strategies**

Issues fall into distinct categories with different fix approaches:

**Systemic Issues** (Agent Hook Event System):
- Require investigation of Kiro IDE integration
- May need Kiro team assistance
- High complexity, high impact
- Must be fixed together

**Script Implementation Issues**:
- Straightforward code fixes
- Low to moderate complexity
- Can be fixed independently
- Low risk

**Documentation Gaps**:
- Documentation updates only
- Low complexity
- Can be fixed anytime
- No code changes needed

This categorization enables appropriate resource allocation and scheduling for each fix type.

**Example**: Each issue has dedicated investigation findings in investigation-notes.md with root cause analysis, impact assessment, and fix recommendations.

---

### Criterion 2: Shared root causes identified

**Evidence**: Only Issues #001 and #003 share a root cause; all other issues are independent

**Verification**:
- ✅ Identified that Issues #001 and #003 share root cause (Kiro IDE event system)
- ✅ Confirmed Issues #002, #004, #005, #006, #007 have independent root causes
- ✅ Created analysis matrix showing root cause relationships
- ✅ Documented evidence for shared vs independent classification

**Example**: 

| Issue | Root Cause | Shared With |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| #001 | Agent hook event system | #003 |
| #003 | Agent hook event system | #001 |
| #002 | Argument parsing bug | None |
| #004 | Documentation gap | None |
| #005 | Historical gap (RESOLVED) | None |
| #006 | Implementation reliability | None |

---

### Criterion 3: Fix grouping recommendations provided

**Evidence**: Three-tier priority system with clear grouping strategy

**Verification**:
- ✅ Priority 1 (CRITICAL): Agent hook issues (#001, #003) - Fix together
- ✅ Priority 2 (IMPORTANT): File organization issues (#006, #007) - Fix together
- ✅ Priority 3 (MINOR): Other issues (#002, #004, #005) - Fix separately
- ✅ Rationale provided for each grouping decision
- ✅ Estimated effort provided for each priority tier
- ✅ Alternative strategies considered and rejected with reasoning

**Example**: Priority 1 groups agent hook issues because they share the same root cause and must be diagnosed together. Estimated effort: 2-3 days. Blocks all automation.

---

### Criterion 4: Independent vs related issues clarified

**Evidence**: Clear classification of all issues with supporting analysis

**Verification**:
- ✅ 2 of 7 issues are related (share root cause)
- ✅ 5 of 7 issues are independent
- ✅ Independence analysis provided for each issue
- ✅ Cross-system analysis shows different failure modes
- ✅ Impact analysis shows file organization doesn't affect release detection

**Example**: File organization issues (#005, #006, #007) are independent from agent hook issues (#001, #003) because they affect different systems (scripts vs event handling), have different failure modes (execution vs no execution), and have no dependencies between them.

## Overall Integration Story

### Complete Investigation of Related Issues

The investigation of related infrastructure issues revealed a clear pattern: **most issues are independent**, with only the agent hook issues sharing a root cause.

**Investigation Flow**:

1. **Task 5.1** investigated commit-task.sh --help handling and found an independent script bug in argument parsing
2. **Task 5.2** investigated hook dependency chain clarity and found a documentation gap that amplifies but doesn't cause the agent hook failure
3. **Task 5.3** investigated three file organization issues and found they are independent from release detection with zero impact
4. **Task 5.4** synthesized all findings and created a three-tier priority system for fixes

**Key Discovery**: The independence of most issues means fixes can proceed in parallel without coordination overhead. Only the agent hook issues (#001, #003) require coordinated fixing.
