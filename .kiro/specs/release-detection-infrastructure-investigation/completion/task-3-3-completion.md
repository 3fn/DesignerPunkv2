**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Task**: 3.3 Investigate hook dependency chains
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/specs/release-detection-infrastructure-investigation/tests/test-dependency-chain.sh` - Test script for dependency chain investigation
- Updated `.kiro/specs/release-detection-infrastructure-investigation/investigation-notes.md` - Added comprehensive dependency chain findings
- Updated `.kiro/specs/release-detection-infrastructure-investigation/tests/README.md` - Documented new test script

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Investigated hook dependency chains by analyzing configuration files and documenting the intended behavior of the `runAfter` setting. Since Kiro IDE provides no logging for agent hook execution and bash scripts cannot trigger `taskStatusChange` events, the investigation focused on:

1. **Configuration Analysis**: Examined hook JSON files to understand dependency chain setup
2. **Documentation Review**: Analyzed how `runAfter` is configured and what it should do
3. **Limitation Documentation**: Clearly documented what cannot be tested programmatically
4. **Manual Testing Recommendations**: Provided guidance for testing with actual IDE events

### Key Findings

**Dependency Chain Configuration**:
- Release detection hook specifies `runAfter: ["organize-after-task-completion"]`
- Both hooks trigger on same event (`taskStatusChange` with `status="completed"`)
- File organization runs first (no dependencies), release detection runs second (depends on organization)
- Configuration is properly formatted and hook IDs match correctly

**Execution Settings**:
- File organization: Interactive (requires user confirmation, 10-minute timeout)
- Release detection: Automatic (auto-approve, 5-minute timeout)
- Settings reflect appropriate behavior for each hook's purpose

**Rationale for Dependency**:
- File organization may move completion documents to proper directories
- Release detection scans for completion documents in organized locations
- Detection should see final file structure, not temporary locations
- Dependency ensures correct execution order

**Investigation Limitations**:
- Cannot trigger `taskStatusChange` events from bash scripts
- Cannot test actual hook execution order programmatically
- Cannot verify `runAfter` behavior without IDE events
- Cannot test failure scenarios without actual failures
- Kiro IDE provides no logging for hook execution

### Test Script Created

**Script**: `tests/test-dependency-chain.sh`

**Purpose**: Document dependency chain configuration and provide testing approach

**What It Does**:
- Analyzes hook configuration files
- Documents intended dependency chain execution order
- Explains testing limitations clearly
- Provides manual testing recommendations
- Documents questions requiring resolution

**What It Cannot Do**:
- Cannot trigger actual hook execution
- Cannot test dependency chain behavior programmatically
- Cannot verify `runAfter` works correctly
- Cannot test failure scenarios from bash

**Output**: Comprehensive analysis showing:
- Hook configurations with dependency settings
- Intended execution order diagram
- Test scenarios for manual testing
- Limitations and recommendations
- Questions requiring IDE-level testing

### Questions Documented

**Behavioral Questions Requiring Manual Testing**:

1. **Does `runAfter` wait for success or completion?**
   - Does dependent hook run if prerequisite fails?
   - Does dependent hook run if prerequisite times out?
   - Does dependent hook run if user cancels prerequisite?

2. **What is the error propagation behavior?**
   - Are errors from prerequisite hooks propagated to dependent hooks?
   - Is there logging of dependency chain failures?
   - How are cascading failures handled?

3. **How are circular dependencies handled?**
   - Does Kiro IDE detect circular dependencies?
   - What happens if Hook A depends on Hook B and vice versa?

4. **What happens with missing dependencies?**
   - What if `runAfter` references a non-existent hook ID?
   - Is there validation of dependency references?

### Integration with Previous Findings

**Relationship to Script Stall Issue** (Task 2.4):
- Even if dependency chain works correctly, release detection will stall on npm command
- Fixing npm syntax bug is prerequisite to testing dependency chain
- Cannot determine if dependency chain works until script completes successfully

**Relationship to Hook Triggering Issue** (Task 3.2):
- Cannot test dependency chain if hooks aren't triggering at all
- Need to verify hooks trigger before testing dependency behavior
- Historical evidence suggests hooks worked previously

**Testing Order for Fix Spec**:
1. Fix npm syntax bug in release-manager.sh
2. Verify hooks trigger on `taskStatusChange` events
3. Test dependency chain behavior with manual scenarios
4. Document actual dependency chain behavior

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ Test script has no syntax errors
✅ Investigation notes properly formatted
✅ README updated correctly

### Functional Validation
✅ Test script executes successfully
✅ Test script provides comprehensive configuration analysis
✅ Test script documents testing limitations clearly
✅ Test script provides actionable manual testing recommendations

### Integration Validation
✅ Findings integrated into investigation notes
✅ Test script documented in tests README
✅ Findings reference previous investigation tasks
✅ Recommendations align with overall investigation approach

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 2.4: Documented how `runAfter` setting works
✅ Requirement 2.4: Documented intended dependency chain behavior
✅ Requirement 2.4: Documented execution order from configuration
✅ Requirement 2.4: Documented rationale for dependencies
⚠️ Requirement 2.4: Cannot verify dependency chains execute correctly (requires IDE events)
✅ Requirement 2.4: Documented what manual testing is required

**Partial Compliance Note**: Configuration analysis is complete, but actual execution verification requires manual testing with Kiro IDE events that cannot be triggered from bash scripts. This is a fundamental limitation of the investigation environment, not a gap in the investigation process.

## Key Insights

### Configuration is Correct

The dependency chain is properly configured:
- Hook IDs match correctly
- `runAfter` syntax is correct
- Execution settings are appropriate
- Rationale for dependency is clear and valid

### Testing Requires IDE Events

The fundamental limitation is that bash scripts cannot:
- Trigger Kiro IDE events
- Simulate agent hook system behavior
- Test hook execution order
- Verify `runAfter` dependency resolution

This is not a failure of the investigation - it's a limitation of the testing environment. Manual testing with actual IDE events is required.

### Manual Testing Protocol Needed

The fix spec should include:
- Step-by-step manual testing instructions
- Test scenarios for normal execution
- Test scenarios for failure cases
- Test scenarios for cancellation cases
- Test scenarios for timeout cases
- Documentation of observed behavior

### Questions for Fix Spec

The fix spec must answer:
1. Does release detection wait for file organization to complete?
2. Does release detection run if file organization fails?
3. Does release detection run if user cancels file organization?
4. Does release detection run if file organization times out?
5. Is there error propagation between hooks?

## Recommendations

### For Fix Spec

1. **Include Manual Testing Protocol**: Provide step-by-step instructions for testing dependency chain with `taskStatus` tool
2. **Test All Scenarios**: Test normal execution, failures, cancellations, and timeouts
3. **Document Actual Behavior**: Record what actually happens in each scenario
4. **Validate Configuration**: Confirm configuration matches observed behavior
5. **Request IDE Logging**: Recommend Kiro IDE team add hook execution logging

### For Future Investigations

1. **Recognize Testing Limitations Early**: Identify what cannot be tested programmatically
2. **Focus on Configuration Analysis**: When execution testing isn't possible, analyze configuration thoroughly
3. **Provide Manual Testing Guidance**: Give clear instructions for manual testing
4. **Document Questions**: Clearly list questions that require manual testing to answer
5. **Request IDE Improvements**: Identify gaps in IDE logging and debugging capabilities

## Lessons Learned

### Configuration Analysis is Valuable

Even without execution testing, configuration analysis provides:
- Understanding of intended behavior
- Validation of configuration correctness
- Identification of potential issues
- Guidance for manual testing

### Testing Limitations Should Be Explicit

Clearly documenting what cannot be tested:
- Sets appropriate expectations
- Guides manual testing efforts
- Identifies gaps in tooling
- Helps prioritize IDE improvements

### Manual Testing is Sometimes Required

Not everything can be automated:
- IDE event systems require IDE interaction
- Hook execution requires IDE events
- Some behaviors can only be observed manually
- Manual testing protocols are valuable deliverables

## Requirements Compliance

✅ **Requirement 2.4**: "WHEN the investigation examines hook dependencies, THEN the investigation SHALL document how the `runAfter` setting works and whether dependency chains execute correctly"

**Compliance Details**:
- ✅ Documented how `runAfter` is configured
- ✅ Documented intended dependency chain behavior
- ✅ Documented execution order from configuration
- ✅ Documented rationale for dependencies
- ⚠️ Cannot verify dependency chains execute correctly (requires IDE events)
- ✅ Documented what manual testing is required to verify execution

**Partial Compliance Rationale**: Configuration analysis is complete and thorough. Actual execution verification requires manual testing with Kiro IDE events that cannot be triggered from bash scripts. This is a fundamental limitation of the investigation environment, not a gap in the investigation process. The investigation provides all necessary information for manual testing during fix implementation.
