# Design Document: Release Detection and Infrastructure Automation Investigation

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Spec**: release-detection-infrastructure-investigation
**Status**: Design Phase
**Dependencies**: phase-1-discovery-audit (completed)

## Overview

The Release Detection and Infrastructure Automation Investigation provides a systematic approach to understanding why infrastructure automation fails. This investigation traces through the complete event flow from task completion to release detection, identifies failure points, tests hypotheses about root causes, and documents findings to inform fix specifications.

This design establishes the investigation methodology, documentation format, test approach, and deliverable structure for understanding infrastructure automation failures without implementing fixes.

## Investigation Methodology

### Phase 1: System Understanding

**Goal:** Understand how the system is supposed to work

**Activities:**
1. Read hook configuration files
2. Read script implementations
3. Document intended event flow
4. Identify all components involved
5. Map dependencies between components

**Deliverable:** System design documentation in investigation notes

**Example:**
```markdown
## Intended Event Flow

1. Developer marks task complete using taskStatus tool
2. Kiro IDE emits taskStatusChange event with status="completed"
3. Agent hook system receives event
4. Agent hook system matches event against hook configurations
5. File organization hook executes (if configured)
6. Release detection hook executes (runAfter file organization)
7. Release manager script scans for completion documents
8. Release manager creates trigger files
9. Release analyzer processes triggers
```

---

### Phase 2: Behavior Tracing

**Goal:** Understand what actually happens

**Activities:**
1. Manually trigger the workflow
2. Observe actual behavior at each step
3. Check logs for evidence of execution
4. Identify where actual deviates from intended
5. Document all observations with evidence

**Deliverable:** Behavior observations in investigation notes

**Example:**
```markdown
## Actual Behavior Observed

1. ✅ Developer marks task complete using taskStatus tool
2. ✅ Task status updates in tasks.md
3. ❓ Unknown if Kiro IDE emits taskStatusChange event (no logging)
4. ❓ Unknown if agent hook system receives event (no logging)
5. ❌ File organization hook does NOT execute (no evidence in logs)
6. ❌ Release detection hook does NOT execute (no evidence in logs)
7. ❌ No trigger files created
8. ❌ Release analyzer finds 0 completion documents

**Failure Point:** Somewhere between steps 2 and 5
```

---

### Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing

**Goal:** Test theories about why it fails

**Approach:**
1. Formulate hypothesis based on observations
2. Design test to verify hypothesis
3. Create test script if needed
4. Execute test and observe results
5. Document whether hypothesis confirmed or rejected

**Test Script Location:** `.kiro/specs/release-detection-infrastructure-investigation/tests/`

**Example Hypothesis Testing:**

```markdown
## Hypothesis 1: Kiro IDE Not Emitting Events

**Hypothesis:** Kiro IDE doesn't emit taskStatusChange events when taskStatus tool is used

**Test Approach:** 
- Create test script that listens for events (if possible)
- Check Kiro IDE documentation for event system
- Test with different event types

**Test Script:** `tests/test-event-emission.sh`

**Result:** [To be determined during investigation]

**Evidence:** [Logs, outputs, observations]
```

---

### Phase 4: Root Cause Analysis

**Goal:** Synthesize findings into root cause explanation

**Activities:**
1. Review all investigation findings
2. Identify the fundamental cause
3. Categorize the issue type
4. Identify related issues with same root cause
5. Recommend fix approach
6. Document test file cleanup decisions

**Deliverable:** Root cause analysis document

## Investigation Areas

### Area 1: Release Detection Hook (Issue #001)

**Investigation Questions:**
- Does Kiro IDE emit taskStatusChange events?
- Is the hook configuration properly formatted?
- Is the hook registered with Kiro IDE?
- Does the event type match correctly?
- Does the runAfter dependency work?
- Does the script work when invoked manually?

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Manual script invocation: `./.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto`
2. Direct hook trigger (if possible)
3. Different event types (if applicable)
4. Dependency chain testing

**Expected Findings:**
- Exact failure point in event flow
- Whether this is Kiro IDE, configuration, or script issue
- What needs to change to fix it

---

### Area 2: Agent Hook System (Issue #003)

**Investigation Questions:**
- How does Kiro IDE's agent hook system work?
- Are hooks properly registered?
- Do ANY hooks trigger on taskStatusChange?
- Is there logging for hook execution?
- How do hook dependencies work?

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Test file organization hook triggering
2. Test other hooks (if any exist)
3. Review Kiro IDE documentation
4. Check for hook execution logs

**Expected Findings:**
- Whether this is systemic (all hooks fail) or isolated (specific hooks fail)
- How hook registration works
- What logging exists or is needed

---

### Area 3: Infrastructure Workflow (General)

**Investigation Questions:**
- What is the complete automation workflow?
- Which steps work and which don't?
- What are the dependencies?
- What works manually vs automatically?

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Manual execution of each workflow step
2. Test workflow with different entry points
3. Test dependency chains

**Expected Findings:**
- Complete workflow diagram (intended vs actual)
- Failure points clearly identified
- Dependencies documented

---

### Area 4: Related Issues (#002, #004, #005, #006, #007)

**Investigation Questions:**
- Do these issues share root causes?
- Should they be fixed together or separately?
- Are there systemic patterns?

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Test commit-task.sh with --help flag
2. Test file organization metadata validation
3. Test cross-reference update logic
4. Test file organization scope

**Expected Findings:**
- Which issues are related vs independent
- Whether they share root causes
- Fix grouping recommendations

### Test File Cleanup Decision Process

**During Investigation:**
- Create test files as needed
- Document each test in investigation notes
- Record test results

**At Investigation Completion:**
- Review each test file
- Assess usefulness for fix spec
- Document keep/delete decisions in root cause analysis

**Keep Tests That:**
- Validate fixes work correctly
- Provide regression testing value
- Test system behavior that should be maintained

**Delete Tests That:**
- Test one-time hypotheses
- Duplicate existing tests
- Have no value beyond investigation

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Investigation-Only Spec (No Fixes)

**Options Considered:**
1. Investigation and fix in same spec
2. Investigation spec followed by separate fix spec (chosen)
3. Skip investigation, go straight to fixes

**Decision:** Separate investigation and fix specs

**Rationale:**
- Investigation requires different mindset than fixing
- Prevents premature fixes based on incomplete understanding
- Allows review of findings before committing to fix approach
- Enables informed decision about whether to fix, defer, or redesign

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ **Gained:** Thorough understanding, informed decisions, prevents bad fixes
- ❌ **Lost:** Slightly slower (two specs instead of one)
- ⚠️ **Risk:** Could lead to analysis paralysis if not time-boxed

---

### Decision 2: Strict "Look, Don't Touch" Policy

**Options Considered:**
1. Allow syntax fixes during investigation
2. Allow "obvious" fixes during investigation
3. Strict no-modification policy (chosen)

**Decision:** Strict no-modification policy

**Rationale:**
- Preserves investigation integrity
- Maintains evidence in original state
- Prevents scope creep from "just fixing this small thing"
- Ensures findings based on actual system state
- Avoids invalidating investigation by changing what's being investigated

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ **Gained:** Investigation integrity, clear evidence, no scope creep
- ❌ **Lost:** Can't fix obvious errors immediately
- ⚠️ **Risk:** Frustration when obvious fixes are found but can't be implemented

---

### Decision 3: Test Files in Investigation Directory

**Options Considered:**
1. Create test files anywhere in codebase
2. Create test files in investigation directory (chosen)
3. Don't create test files, only document tests

**Decision:** Test files in investigation directory only

**Rationale:**
- Keeps investigation artifacts organized
- Prevents codebase pollution
- Makes cleanup decisions explicit
- Enables selective reuse in fix spec
- Clear ownership of test files

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ **Gained:** Organization, clear ownership, easy cleanup
- ❌ **Lost:** Slight inconvenience of different directory
- ⚠️ **Risk:** Tests might not reflect production environment exactly

---

## Success Criteria

The investigation design is successful when:

1. ✅ Clear methodology for each investigation phase
2. ✅ Systematic approach to hypothesis testing
3. ✅ Comprehensive documentation format
4. ✅ Test file management process defined
5. ✅ Root cause analysis template established
6. ✅ "Look, don't touch" policy clearly defined
