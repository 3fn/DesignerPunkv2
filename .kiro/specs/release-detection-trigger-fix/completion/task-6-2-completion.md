# Task 6.2 Completion: Remove Test Response Files

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Task**: 6.2 Remove test response files
**Type**: Setup
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Removed

- `test-hook-edited-response.txt` - Test response file from hook testing
- `parent-task-hook-triggered.txt` - Test response file from parent task hook testing
- `test-hook-response.txt` - Already removed (not found during cleanup)

## Implementation Notes

Removed all test response files that were created during hook testing phases. These files were temporary artifacts used to verify hook execution and are no longer needed now that the hook system is validated and working correctly.

The `test-hook-response.txt` file was not found during cleanup, indicating it was already removed in a previous cleanup operation.

## Validation (Tier 1: Minimal)

### Artifact Verification
✅ `test-hook-edited-response.txt` removed
✅ `parent-task-hook-triggered.txt` removed
✅ `test-hook-response.txt` already removed (not found)
✅ No test response files remain in root directory

### Basic Structure Validation
✅ Verified no test response files exist using grep pattern
✅ Repository root directory cleaned of test artifacts
✅ All specified test response files removed
