# Task 4.2 Completion: Update Directory Structure Documentation

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Task**: 4.2 Update directory structure documentation
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Modified

- `.kiro/steering/File Organization Standards.md` - Updated "Spec-Specific Organization" section with two-directory structure

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Updated the "Spec-Specific Organization" section in File Organization Standards to clearly show both `docs/specs/` and `.kiro/specs/` directory structures with explicit indicators for which files trigger hooks.

The update transforms a simple directory listing into a comprehensive explanation of the two-directory structure, making it immediately clear to developers:
- Which directory triggers hooks (docs/specs/)
- Which directory doesn't trigger hooks (.kiro/specs/)
- Why this separation exists
- What the purpose of each location is

### Key Changes

**1. Added Two-Directory Structure Header**

Added an introductory statement explaining that spec documentation is organized across two directories to enable automatic release detection while maintaining comprehensive internal documentation.

**2. Enhanced Directory Listings with Hook Indicators**

- Added ✅ checkmarks for files that trigger hooks (summary docs in docs/specs/)
- Added ❌ X marks for files that don't trigger hooks (all files in .kiro/specs/)
- Added inline comments explaining the purpose of each location
- Added hook pattern documentation (**/task-*-summary.md)
- Added note about Kiro IDE file watching behavior

**3. Added Key Distinctions Table**

Created a comparison table showing:
- Location (docs/specs/ vs .kiro/specs/)
- Purpose (concise summaries vs comprehensive docs)
- Hook Trigger (Yes vs No)
- Audience (public-facing vs internal)

**4. Added "Why Two Directories?" Section**

Explained the rationale for the two-directory structure:
- Hook triggering (.kiro/ directory is filtered from file watching)
- Dual purpose (summary docs as hook triggers and release notes)
- Clear separation (detailed internal docs vs public-facing summaries)

**5. Added File Naming Patterns Section**

Documented the naming conventions for:
- Summary docs: task-N-summary.md
- Detailed parent docs: task-N-parent-completion.md
- Subtask docs: task-N.M-completion.md

### Visual Clarity Improvements

The updated section uses several visual techniques to improve clarity:

**Inline Comments**: Added comments directly in the directory tree structure to explain purpose
```
docs/specs/[spec-name]/                   # Public-facing documentation (TRIGGERS HOOKS)
├── task-1-summary.md                     # ✅ Parent task summary (triggers release detection)
```

**Checkmarks and X Marks**: Visual indicators make it immediately obvious which files trigger hooks
- ✅ = Triggers hooks
- ❌ = Does not trigger hooks

**Structured Explanations**: Organized information into clear sections (Key Distinctions, Why Two Directories?, File Naming Patterns) rather than a single block of text

**Table Format**: Used a table to compare the two directories side-by-side for easy comparison

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ Markdown formatting correct
✅ All code blocks properly formatted

### Functional Validation
✅ Directory structure accurately represents both docs/specs/ and .kiro/specs/
✅ Hook trigger indicators (✅/❌) correctly applied to all files
✅ Comments explain purpose of each location
✅ File naming patterns documented with examples

### Integration Validation
✅ Integrates with existing File Organization Standards structure
✅ Consistent with Summary Documents section earlier in document
✅ Aligns with Development Workflow documentation
✅ References match actual directory structure in repository

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 5.2: Updated "Spec-Specific Organization" section
✅ Requirement 5.2: Shows both docs/specs/ and .kiro/specs/ structures
✅ Requirement 5.2: Clearly indicates which files trigger hooks
✅ Requirement 5.2: Includes comments explaining purpose of each location

*This update provides clear visual guidance on the two-directory structure for spec documentation, making it immediately obvious which files trigger hooks and why the separation exists.*
