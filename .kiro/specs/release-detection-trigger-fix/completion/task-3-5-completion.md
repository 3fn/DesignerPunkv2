# Task 3.5 Completion: Add .kiro/ Directory Filtering Explanation

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Task**: 3.5 Add .kiro/ directory filtering explanation
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Modified

- `.kiro/steering/Development Workflow.md` - Added new section "Kiro IDE File Watching Behavior"

## Implementation Details

Added a comprehensive new section to the Development Workflow documentation explaining the `.kiro/` directory filtering behavior in Kiro IDE. This section clarifies why hooks don't trigger on files created in the `.kiro/` directory and why summary documents must be created in `docs/specs/[spec-name]/` instead.

The section includes:

1. **Overview**: Clear statement that `.kiro/` directory is filtered from file watching
2. **Directories Where Hooks Will NOT Trigger**: Comprehensive list of `.kiro/` subdirectories with explanations
3. **Directories Where Hooks WILL Trigger**: List of watched directories including `docs/`, `src/`, root, etc.
4. **Why This Matters for Release Detection**: Explanation of the two-document workflow and how filtering affects it
5. **Common Mistake**: Clear example showing wrong vs correct summary document location
6. **Design Rationale**: Benefits and implications of the filtering behavior

The section uses clear visual indicators (❌ and ✅) to make it easy to scan and understand which directories are filtered vs watched. Code examples show the common mistake and correct approach side-by-side.

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ Markdown formatting correct
✅ Code blocks properly formatted

### Functional Validation
✅ Section explains `.kiro/` directory filtering clearly
✅ Lists all relevant `.kiro/` subdirectories that are filtered
✅ Lists watched directories where hooks will trigger
✅ Explains why this matters for summary document location
✅ Provides clear examples of wrong vs correct locations

### Integration Validation
✅ Section placed logically after "Manual Release Detection" section
✅ Integrates with existing "Automatic Release Detection" section
✅ Complements "Release Detection Not Triggering" troubleshooting section
✅ Consistent with terminology used throughout document

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 6.4: Explains `.kiro/` directory filtering behavior
✅ Requirement 6.4: Lists directories where hooks will/won't trigger
✅ Requirement 6.4: Explains why this matters for summary document location
✅ Requirement 6.4: Provides clear guidance to prevent common mistakes

## Implementation Notes

The section was strategically placed after "Manual Release Detection" to provide context for why automatic detection might not work (if files are in the wrong location). The visual indicators (❌ and ✅) make it easy to quickly scan and understand the filtering behavior.

The "Common Mistake" subsection directly addresses the most likely error developers will make - creating summary documents in `.kiro/` instead of `docs/` - with a clear side-by-side comparison showing the wrong and correct approaches.

The "Design Rationale" subsection explains the benefits of this filtering behavior, helping developers understand it's an intentional design decision rather than a limitation, which should reduce frustration and improve adoption of the two-document workflow.
