# Task 4.FIX.1 Completion: Update Spec Planning Standards with Manual Trigger Requirement

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Task**: 4.FIX.1 Update Spec Planning Standards with manual trigger requirement
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Modified

- `.kiro/steering/Spec Planning Standards.md` - Updated Parent Task Summary Documents section with manual trigger requirement and hook limitation documentation

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Updated the Spec Planning Standards document to reflect the hook limitation discovered during Task 4 completion: Kiro IDE's `fileCreated` and `fileSaved` hooks only trigger for manual file operations through the IDE UI, not for programmatically created files by AI agents.

The implementation added documentation in three key areas:

1. **Hook Limitation Section**: Added explicit documentation of the hook limitation with hybrid approach explanation
2. **Success Criteria**: Added "Release detection triggered" to parent task success criteria examples
3. **Post-Completion Step**: Added manual trigger step to parent task format examples
4. **Important Note**: Added detailed note about hook behavior for AI-assisted workflows

### Key Implementation Decisions

**Decision 1**: Document hybrid approach rather than remove automatic hooks

**Rationale**: Automatic hooks still work for manually created files through IDE UI, so they provide value for manual workflows. Documenting both automatic and manual approaches gives developers flexibility.

**Decision 2**: Add "Release detection triggered" to success criteria

**Rationale**: Makes it explicit that triggering release detection is part of completing a parent task, ensuring developers don't forget this step in AI-assisted workflows.

**Decision 3**: Add post-completion step with manual trigger command

**Rationale**: Provides clear, actionable guidance on how to trigger release detection after creating summary documents programmatically.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Hook Limitation Section

Added new section after "When to Create" explaining the hook limitation:

```markdown
**Hook Limitation**: Kiro IDE's `fileCreated` and `fileSaved` hooks only trigger for manual file operations through the IDE UI, not for programmatically created files by AI agents. This requires a hybrid approach:
- **Automatic hooks**: Work for manually created/edited files through IDE UI
- **Manual trigger**: Required for AI-assisted workflows after summary document creation
```

### 2. Updated Rationale Section

Added "Hybrid Approach" bullet to rationale explaining the dual-mode operation:

```markdown
- **Hybrid Approach**: Automatic hooks for manual edits, manual trigger for AI workflows ensures release detection works in all scenarios.
```

### 3. Updated Parent Task Format Examples

Updated both Example 1 and Example 5 to include:

**Success Criteria Addition**:
```markdown
- Release detection triggered
```

**Post-Completion Section**:
```markdown
**Post-Completion:**
- Run `./.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto` to trigger release detection
```

### 4. Added Important Note on Hook Behavior

Added detailed note after "Forward-Looking Note" explaining the workflow for AI-assisted development:

```markdown
**Important Note on Hook Behavior**: Kiro IDE's `fileCreated` and `fileSaved` hooks only trigger for manual file operations through the IDE UI, not for programmatically created files by AI agents. When working with AI agents to create summary documents:
1. Create the summary document programmatically as part of task completion
2. Manually run `./.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto` to trigger release detection
3. This manual trigger is the standard practice for AI-assisted workflows
```

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ All markdown formatting correct
✅ Code blocks properly formatted

### Functional Validation
✅ Hook limitation clearly documented in multiple locations
✅ Manual trigger requirement added to success criteria
✅ Post-completion step provides clear command
✅ Hybrid approach explained in rationale

### Integration Validation
✅ Changes integrate with existing Parent Task Summary Documents section
✅ Examples updated consistently (both Example 1 and Example 5)
✅ Documentation flows logically from limitation to solution
✅ Cross-references to other sections maintained

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 3.1: Added "Release detection triggered" to parent task success criteria
✅ Requirement 3.2: Added post-completion step with manual trigger command
✅ Requirement 6.1: Documented hybrid approach (automatic for manual edits, manual for AI workflows)
✅ Requirement 6.2: Updated parent task template examples with both additions
✅ Added note about hook limitation (only triggers for IDE UI actions)

## Impact

### Documentation Clarity
- Developers now understand why automatic hooks don't work for AI-created files
- Clear guidance on when to use automatic vs manual triggers
- Explicit success criteria includes release detection

### Workflow Guidance
- Post-completion step provides exact command to run
- Hybrid approach documented for different workflows
- No ambiguity about when manual trigger is needed

### Future Specs
- All future specs will include "Release detection triggered" in success criteria
- All future specs will include post-completion manual trigger step
- Developers will know to run manual trigger after AI-assisted task completion
