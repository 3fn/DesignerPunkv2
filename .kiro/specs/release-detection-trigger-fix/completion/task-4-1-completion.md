# Task 4.1 Completion: Add Summary Document Organization Metadata

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Task**: 4.1 Add summary document organization metadata
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/steering/File Organization Standards.md` - Updated with "Summary Documents" section

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Added a new "Summary Documents" section to the File Organization Standards document to define the organization metadata for parent task summary documents. This section was inserted after "Spec-Specific Completion" and before "Process Standards" in the "Organization Field Values" section.

The implementation includes:
1. Complete metadata definition with organization value `spec-summary` and scope `[spec-name]`
2. Clear purpose statement explaining dual purpose (hook trigger + release notes)
3. Location specification (`docs/specs/[spec-name]/`)
4. Naming convention standards (`task-N-summary.md`)
5. Rationale explaining why summary docs are in `docs/` not `.kiro/` (file watching behavior)
6. Example metadata header showing complete format

### Key Decisions

**Decision 1**: Place section after Spec-Specific Completion
- **Rationale**: Summary documents are related to completion documentation, so placing them adjacent makes logical sense
- **Alternative**: Could have placed at end of organization values, but grouping related concepts is better for navigation

**Decision 2**: Include comprehensive rationale
- **Rationale**: The `.kiro/` directory filtering behavior is non-obvious and critical to understanding why summary docs exist
- **Alternative**: Could have been brief, but comprehensive explanation prevents confusion

**Decision 3**: Provide complete example with all sections
- **Rationale**: Shows developers exactly what a summary document should look like
- **Alternative**: Could have referenced Spec Planning Standards, but inline example is more convenient

### Integration Points

The summary document organization metadata integrates with:
- **Spec Planning Standards**: References the summary document format defined there
- **Development Workflow**: Explains the two-document workflow for parent tasks
- **File Organization System**: Adds new organization value to the metadata-driven system
- **Hook System**: Enables automatic release detection through file watching

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ Markdown formatting correct
✅ Code blocks properly formatted

### Functional Validation
✅ Summary Documents section added with all required content
✅ Organization metadata defined: `spec-summary`, scope: `[spec-name]`
✅ Location documented: `docs/specs/[spec-name]/`
✅ Example metadata header included with complete format
✅ Naming convention specified: `task-N-summary.md`
✅ Rationale explains `.kiro/` directory filtering

### Integration Validation
✅ Section placed logically after Spec-Specific Completion
✅ Directory structure updated to show `docs/specs/[spec-name]/` location
✅ Manual organization process updated to include `spec-summary`
✅ Organization decision guidelines updated with Spec-Summary Criteria
✅ Consistent with existing organization metadata patterns

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 5.1: Summary document organization metadata added
✅ Requirement 5.2: Organization value `spec-summary` and scope `[spec-name]` defined
✅ Requirement 5.2: Location `docs/specs/[spec-name]/` documented
✅ Requirement 5.2: Example with metadata header included

## Requirements Compliance

**Requirement 5.1**: Summary document organization metadata added to File Organization Standards
- Added "Summary Documents" section with complete metadata definition
- Includes organization value, scope, purpose, location, and examples

**Requirement 5.2**: Organization and location clearly documented
- Organization: `spec-summary`
- Scope: `[spec-name]`
- Location: `docs/specs/[spec-name]/`
- Example metadata header shows complete format with all required sections
