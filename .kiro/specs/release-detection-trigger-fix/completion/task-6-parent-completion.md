## Implementation Details

### Cleanup Strategy

The cleanup process followed a systematic approach to remove all test artifacts created during Task 5 validation testing while preserving historical context for deprecated hook configurations:

1. **Test Hook Removal**: Deleted all test hook files that validated trigger behavior
2. **Test Response Cleanup**: Removed temporary response files from hook execution tests
3. **Test Markdown Cleanup**: Removed test summary documents and test spec directories
4. **Configuration Archival**: Moved deprecated hook configs to archive with documentation

### Archival Approach

Rather than deleting the old `.json` hook configurations, we archived them with comprehensive documentation. This preserves:

- **Historical Context**: Why the hooks were created and what they attempted to accomplish
- **Failure Analysis**: Documentation of the unsupported trigger type issue
- **Lessons Learned**: Insights about hook trigger type verification
- **Migration Notes**: Reference for future hook development

The archive README.md provides complete context for anyone investigating the hook system evolution.

✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ All markdown formatting correct in archive README.md

### Functional Validation
✅ All test hook files successfully removed
✅ All test response files successfully removed
✅ All test markdown files successfully removed
✅ Old hook configurations successfully archived
✅ Archive directory created with comprehensive documentation

### Design Validation
✅ Archival approach preserves historical context
✅ Documentation explains why hooks were deprecated
✅ Cleanup strategy systematic and complete
✅ Repository structure clean and organized

### System Integration
✅ Production hooks remain intact and functional
✅ No impact on working hook configurations
✅ Archive directory follows project organization standards
✅ Documentation accessible for future reference

### Edge Cases
✅ Handled already-removed files gracefully (test-hook-response.txt)
✅ Verified test-spec directory cleanup (not found, already removed)
✅ Confirmed no orphaned test files remain
✅ Validated archive directory structure

### Subtask Integration
✅ Task 6.1 (test hook removal) completed successfully
✅ Task 6.2 (test response removal) completed successfully
✅ Task 6.3 (test markdown removal) completed successfully
✅ Task 6.4 (configuration archival) completed successfully
✅ All subtasks integrate correctly - repository fully cleaned

## Success Criteria Verification

### Criterion 1: All test files removed from repository

**Evidence**: Comprehensive cleanup of all test artifacts created during Task 5 validation testing.

**Verification**:
- Removed 3 test hook files from `.kiro/hooks/`
- Removed 2 test response files from root directory (1 already removed)
- Removed 5 test markdown files from various locations
- Verified no test files remain using file system checks

**Example**: Repository root directory and test locations verified clean with no remaining test artifacts.

### Criterion 2: Old hook configurations documented and archived

**Evidence**: Deprecated hook configurations moved to archive with comprehensive documentation explaining the unsupported trigger type issue.

**Verification**:
- Created `.kiro/hooks/archive/` directory
- Moved 2 old `.json` hook configs to archive
- Created comprehensive README.md documenting:
  - Why hooks were archived (unsupported `taskStatusChange` trigger)
  - What each hook attempted to accomplish
  - Failure analysis and lessons learned
  - Current replacement strategies

**Example**: Archive README.md provides complete historical context and migration guidance for anyone investigating the hook system evolution.

### Criterion 3: Repository clean and ready for normal use

**Evidence**: All test artifacts removed, deprecated configurations archived, production hooks intact and functional.

**Verification**:
- No test files remain in repository
- Production hooks (release-detection-auto.kiro.hook, release-detection-manual.kiro.hook) intact
- Archive directory organized and documented
- Repository structure clean and ready for ongoing development

**Example**: Repository can now be used for normal development without test artifacts cluttering the workspace.

## Overall Integration Story

### Complete Cleanup Workflow

Task 6 completed the release-detection-trigger-fix spec by systematically cleaning up all test artifacts and archiving deprecated configurations:

1. **Test Hook Removal (6.1)**: Removed test hooks that validated trigger behavior during Task 5
2. **Test Response Cleanup (6.2)**: Removed temporary response files from hook execution tests
3. **Test Markdown Cleanup (6.3)**: Removed test summary documents and verified test directories cleaned
4. **Configuration Archival (6.4)**: Archived deprecated hook configs with comprehensive documentation

This cleanup ensures the repository is ready for normal use with only production hooks and documentation remaining.

### Subtask Contributions

**Task 6.1**: Remove test hook files
- Removed 3 test hook files from `.kiro/hooks/`
- Verified production hooks remain intact
- Confirmed hook directory clean and organized

**Task 6.2**: Remove test response files
- Removed 2 test response files from root directory
- Handled already-removed files gracefully
- Verified no test response files remain

**Task 6.3**: Remove test markdown files
- Removed 5 test markdown files from various locations
- Verified test-spec directory cleanup
- Confirmed no test markdown files remain

**Task 6.4**: Archive old hook configurations
- Created archive directory with comprehensive documentation
- Moved 2 deprecated hook configs to archive
- Preserved historical context and lessons learned

### System Behavior

The repository is now clean and ready for normal development:

- **Production Hooks**: Only working hooks remain (release-detection-auto.kiro.hook, release-detection-manual.kiro.hook)
- **Test Artifacts**: All test files removed from repository
- **Historical Context**: Deprecated configurations archived with documentation
- **Clean Structure**: Repository organized and ready for ongoing work

### User-Facing Capabilities

Developers can now:
- Work in a clean repository without test artifacts
- Reference archived configurations for historical context
- Use production hooks without confusion from test files
- Understand hook system evolution through archive documentation

## Requirements Compliance

✅ Requirement 7.1: Test files removed to clean up repository after validation testing
✅ Requirement 4.1: Old hook configurations archived with documentation explaining unsupported trigger type issue

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

- **Systematic Cleanup**: Breaking cleanup into subtasks (hooks, responses, markdown, archive) ensured nothing was missed
- **Archival Approach**: Preserving deprecated configurations with documentation maintains historical context
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Archive README.md provides complete context for future reference

### Challenges

- **Already-Removed Files**: Some test files had been removed in previous cleanup operations
  - **Resolution**: Handled gracefully by verifying file existence before attempting removal
- **Test File Locations**: Test files scattered across multiple directories
  - **Resolution**: Systematic search across root, docs/specs/, and .kiro/hooks/ directories

### Future Considerations

- **Test Cleanup Automation**: Could create a cleanup script for future test artifact removal
  - Would need to identify test files by naming pattern
  - Could be integrated into test workflow
- **Archive Organization**: As more hooks are deprecated, may need archive subdirectories
  - Could organize by deprecation date or reason
  - Would maintain archive README.md as index

---

## Integration Points

### Dependencies

- **Task 5 Validation**: Cleanup depends on Task 5 validation testing being complete
- **Production Hooks**: Cleanup preserves production hooks created in Task 2

### Dependents

- **Ongoing Development**: Clean repository enables normal development workflow
- **Future Hook Development**: Archive documentation provides reference for hook system evolution

### Extension Points

- **Cleanup Automation**: Could create scripts for automated test artifact cleanup
- **Archive Expansion**: Archive directory can accommodate future deprecated configurations
- **Documentation Updates**: Archive README.md can be updated as hook system evolves

### API Surface

**Archive Directory**:
- `.kiro/hooks/archive/` - Location for deprecated hook configurations
- `README.md` - Documentation explaining archived configurations

**Cleanup Verification**:
- File system checks confirm all test artifacts removed
- Production hooks verified intact and functional

---

*Task 6 complete. Repository cleaned of all test artifacts, deprecated configurations archived with comprehensive documentation, and system ready for normal development use.*
