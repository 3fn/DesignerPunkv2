# Task 4.FIX.2 Completion: Update Development Workflow with Hook Limitation

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Task**: 4.FIX.2 Update Development Workflow with hook limitation
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Modified

- `.kiro/steering/Development Workflow.md` - Updated with hook limitation explanation and hybrid approach

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Updated the Development Workflow document to clearly explain the hook limitation discovered during Task 4 completion: `fileCreated` and `fileSaved` hooks only trigger for manual file operations through the IDE UI, not for programmatically created files by AI agents.

The updates emphasize the hybrid approach as the standard practice:
- Automatic hooks work for manually created/edited files
- Manual trigger required for AI-assisted workflows

### Key Changes

**1. Updated "Automatic Release Detection" Section**

Added prominent hook limitation explanation at the beginning of the section:
- Clarified that hooks only trigger for manual IDE file operations
- Documented the hybrid approach (automatic for manual files, manual trigger for AI workflows)
- Updated workflow steps to include manual trigger step for AI workflows
- Added "Hybrid Approach - When Hooks Trigger" subsection with clear examples
- Documented standard practice for AI-assisted workflows

**2. Updated "Task Completion Workflow" Section**

Modified the recommended process to include manual trigger step:
- Step 4: Manual trigger for AI workflows (`./.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto`)
- Step 5: Automatic detection for manual files (clarified limitation)
- Reordered steps to show manual trigger comes before automatic detection
- Added clear labels: `[MANUAL - AI Workflows]` and `[AUTOMATED - Manual Files]`

**3. Maintained Existing Documentation**

Kept all existing sections intact:
- "Manual Release Detection" section unchanged
- "Kiro IDE File Watching Behavior" section unchanged
- Troubleshooting sections unchanged
- All other workflow documentation unchanged

### Integration Points

The updates integrate with existing documentation:
- References the manual trigger command documented in "Manual Release Detection" section
- Aligns with "Kiro IDE File Watching Behavior" section's explanation of directory filtering
- Complements the troubleshooting guidance for release detection issues

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ Markdown formatting correct
✅ All code blocks properly formatted

### Functional Validation
✅ Hook limitation clearly explained at beginning of "Automatic Release Detection" section
✅ Hybrid approach documented with clear examples of when hooks trigger
✅ Manual trigger emphasized as standard practice for AI-assisted workflows
✅ Workflow steps updated to include manual trigger after summary doc creation
✅ Automatic hook documentation preserved with clarification about when it works

### Integration Validation
✅ Updates integrate with existing "Manual Release Detection" section
✅ Aligns with "Kiro IDE File Watching Behavior" section
✅ Complements troubleshooting guidance
✅ Maintains consistency with other workflow documentation

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 6.1: Hook limitation explanation added to "Automatic Release Detection" section
✅ Requirement 6.2: Workflow steps updated to include manual trigger after summary doc creation
✅ Requirement 6.4: Clarified hooks only trigger for manual file saves through IDE UI
✅ Requirement 6.4: Emphasized manual trigger as standard practice for AI-assisted workflows
