# Task 6.4 Completion: Archive Old Hook Configurations

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Task**: 6.4 Archive old hook configurations
**Type**: Setup
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/hooks/archive/` - Archive directory for deprecated hook configurations
- `.kiro/hooks/archive/README.md` - Documentation explaining why hooks were archived
- `.kiro/hooks/archive/organize-after-task-completion.json` - Archived hook config (moved from `.kiro/agent-hooks/`)
- `.kiro/hooks/archive/task-completion-organization.json` - Archived hook config (moved from `.kiro/agent-hooks/`)

## Implementation Notes

Archived two old `.json` hook configuration files that used unsupported trigger types (`taskStatusChange` and `taskStatus`). These hooks never worked because Kiro IDE only supports `fileCreated`, `fileEdited`, `fileDeleted`, and `manual` trigger types.

Created comprehensive README.md in the archive directory documenting:
- Why the hooks were archived (unsupported trigger types)
- What each hook was trying to accomplish
- Why they failed to execute
- Current replacement strategies
- Lessons learned about hook trigger type verification
- Migration notes for future reference

The archived configurations are preserved for historical reference and to document the investigation that led to the current hook strategy using `fileCreated` triggers on summary documents.

## Validation (Tier 1: Minimal)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors in README.md
✅ All markdown formatting correct

### Artifact Verification
✅ Created `.kiro/hooks/archive/` directory
✅ Moved `organize-after-task-completion.json` to archive
✅ Moved `task-completion-organization.json` to archive
✅ Created comprehensive README.md in archive directory

### Basic Structure Validation
✅ Archive directory accessible at `.kiro/hooks/archive/`
✅ All archived files present in correct location
✅ Original files removed from `.kiro/agent-hooks/` directory
✅ README.md provides clear documentation of archive purpose
