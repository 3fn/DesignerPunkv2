# Task 4.3 Completion: Add Cross-Reference Guidance

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Task**: 4.3 Add cross-reference guidance
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/steering/File Organization Standards.md` - Added "Cross-References Between Summary and Detailed Docs" section

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Added a comprehensive cross-reference guidance section to the File Organization Standards document that explains how to link between summary documents and detailed completion documents. The section was placed immediately after the "Summary Documents" section in the "Organization Field Values" area, providing context right where developers need it when working with the two-document workflow.

### Key Decisions

**Decision 1**: Placement after Summary Documents section
- **Rationale**: Developers reading about summary documents will immediately see how to cross-reference them with detailed docs, providing context at the point of need
- **Alternative**: Could have placed in the "Cross-Reference Standards" section, but that would separate the guidance from the summary document documentation

**Decision 2**: Include both directions (summary→detailed and detailed→summary)
- **Rationale**: While summary→detailed is more critical (public-facing to internal), including both directions provides complete guidance and enables bidirectional navigation
- **Alternative**: Could have only documented summary→detailed, but that would leave developers guessing about the reverse direction

**Decision 3**: Provide working examples with actual spec names
- **Rationale**: Using the actual release-detection-trigger-fix spec as an example makes the guidance concrete and immediately applicable
- **Alternative**: Could have used placeholder examples, but real examples are more helpful

### Integration Points

The cross-reference guidance integrates with:
- **Summary Documents section**: Provides the context for why cross-references are needed
- **Cross-Reference Standards section**: Complements the general cross-reference patterns with specific guidance for summary/detailed doc relationships
- **Tasks.md format**: Shows how to reference both document types in task completion documentation sections

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ Markdown formatting correct
✅ Code blocks properly formatted

### Functional Validation
✅ Section added in correct location (after Summary Documents section)
✅ All required elements included:
  - How to link from summary to detailed docs
  - How to link from detailed docs to summary
  - How to reference both in tasks.md
  - Working examples with relative paths
✅ Relative path calculations explained clearly
✅ Best practices documented

### Integration Validation
✅ Integrates with existing Summary Documents section
✅ Complements Cross-Reference Standards section
✅ Consistent with existing documentation patterns
✅ Examples use actual spec names for clarity

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 5.2: Cross-reference guidance provided for linking between summary and detailed docs
  - Added section "Cross-References Between Summary and Detailed Docs"
  - Documented how to link from summary to detailed docs with relative paths
  - Documented how to link from detailed docs to summary with relative paths
  - Documented how to reference both in tasks.md
  - Included working examples with actual spec names
  - Explained relative path calculation
  - Provided best practices for cross-reference maintenance

## Requirements Compliance

✅ **Requirement 5.2**: Summary document organization metadata and cross-reference guidance
