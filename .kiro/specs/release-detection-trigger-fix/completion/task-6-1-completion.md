# Task 6.1 Completion: Remove Test Hook Files

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Task**: 6.1 Remove test hook files
**Type**: Setup
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Removed

- `.kiro/hooks/test-file-created.kiro.hook` - Test hook for fileCreated trigger validation
- `.kiro/hooks/test-file-edited.kiro.hook` - Test hook for fileEdited trigger validation
- `.kiro/hooks/test-parent-task-completion.kiro.hook` - Test hook for parent task completion validation

## Implementation Notes

Removed all three test hook files that were created during Task 5 validation testing. These files served their purpose in validating hook trigger behavior and are no longer needed now that the production hooks (release-detection-auto.kiro.hook and release-detection-manual.kiro.hook) are in place and validated.

The test hooks confirmed:
- `fileCreated` trigger works for manually created files through IDE UI
- `fileCreated` trigger does NOT work for AI-created files (expected limitation)
- Pattern matching works correctly with `**/task-*-summary.md`
- `.kiro/` directory filtering prevents hooks from triggering on files in that location

## Validation (Tier 1: Minimal)

### Syntax Validation
✅ No syntax validation needed (file deletion task)

### Artifact Verification
✅ Deleted `.kiro/hooks/test-file-created.kiro.hook`
✅ Deleted `.kiro/hooks/test-file-edited.kiro.hook`
✅ Deleted `.kiro/hooks/test-parent-task-completion.kiro.hook`
✅ All specified test hook files removed

### Basic Structure Validation
✅ Verified files no longer exist in `.kiro/hooks/` directory
✅ Production hooks remain intact (release-detection-auto.kiro.hook, release-detection-manual.kiro.hook)
✅ Directory structure clean and ready for normal use
