# Task 5.2 Completion: Test .kiro/ Directory Filtering

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Task**: 5.2 Test .kiro/ directory filtering
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- Test file: `.kiro/specs/test-spec/task-1-summary.md` (created and deleted)
- Validation results documented in this completion doc

## Implementation Details

### Test Procedure

Created a test file in the `.kiro/` directory to verify that Kiro IDE's file watching system properly filters this directory and does NOT trigger hooks for files created there.

**Test Steps**:
1. Recorded baseline log file line count: 3847 lines
2. Created test directory: `.kiro/specs/test-spec/`
3. Created test file: `.kiro/specs/test-spec/task-1-summary.md` with proper summary format
4. Waited 6 seconds to allow time for any hook to trigger
5. Verified log file line count remained unchanged: 3847 lines
6. Checked last log entries to confirm no new hook execution
7. Deleted test file and directory

### Test Results

**Expected Behavior**: Hook should NOT trigger for files in `.kiro/` directory
**Actual Behavior**: Hook did NOT trigger (confirmed)

**Evidence**:
- Log file line count before test: 3847 lines
- Log file line count after test: 3847 lines (no change)
- Last log entry timestamp: 2025-10-30 15:38:13 (no new entries)
- Test file created at approximately 15:45 (no corresponding log entry)

### Why This Test Matters

This test validates a critical aspect of the release detection system design:

1. **Directory Filtering**: Confirms that Kiro IDE filters the `.kiro/` directory from file watching
2. **Design Validation**: Validates the rationale for creating summary documents in `docs/specs/` instead of `.kiro/specs/`
3. **Hook Behavior**: Confirms that the two-document workflow (detailed in `.kiro/`, summary in `docs/`) is necessary
4. **Documentation Accuracy**: Validates that documentation about `.kiro/` filtering is correct

### Integration with Overall Design

This test confirms the design decision documented in:
- **Design Document**: `.kiro/` directory filtering explanation
- **Development Workflow**: Why summary documents must be in `docs/specs/`
- **File Organization Standards**: Two-directory structure rationale

The test validates that:
- Detailed completion docs can remain in `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/` (internal)
- Summary docs must be in `docs/specs/[spec-name]/` (triggers hooks)
- The `.kiro/` directory is reliably filtered from file watching

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ Test file created with valid markdown syntax
✅ No syntax errors in test procedure

### Functional Validation
✅ Test file created successfully in `.kiro/specs/test-spec/`
✅ Hook did NOT trigger (expected behavior confirmed)
✅ Log file showed no new entries after test file creation
✅ Test file and directory deleted successfully

### Integration Validation
✅ Test validates design document assumptions about `.kiro/` filtering
✅ Test confirms Development Workflow documentation is accurate
✅ Test supports File Organization Standards rationale

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 7.5: Verified that files created in `.kiro/` directory do NOT trigger automatic hook (directory filtered from file watching)

## Requirements Compliance

**Requirement 7.5**: "WHEN I create a file in `.kiro/` directory THEN the automatic hook SHALL NOT trigger (`.kiro/` directory is filtered from file watching)"

**Evidence**: 
- Created test file in `.kiro/specs/test-spec/task-1-summary.md`
- Waited 6 seconds for potential hook trigger
- Verified no new log entries (line count unchanged: 3847 lines)
- Confirmed last log entry timestamp predates test file creation
- Hook did NOT trigger as expected

**Conclusion**: Requirement 7.5 is fully satisfied. The `.kiro/` directory is confirmed to be filtered from Kiro IDE file watching, and hooks do not trigger for files created in this directory.

*This test validates a critical design assumption: that the `.kiro/` directory is filtered from file watching, which necessitates the two-document workflow for parent task completion (detailed docs in `.kiro/`, summary docs in `docs/`).*
