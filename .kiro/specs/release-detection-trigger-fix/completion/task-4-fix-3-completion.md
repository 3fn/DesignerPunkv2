# Task 4.FIX.3 Completion: Update File Organization Standards with Hybrid Approach

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Task**: 4.FIX.3 Update File Organization Standards with hybrid approach
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Modified

- `.kiro/steering/File Organization Standards.md` - Updated Summary Document Standards section with hook limitation and hybrid approach

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Updated the Summary Document Standards section in File Organization Standards to document the hook limitation discovered during Task 4 completion: Kiro IDE's `fileCreated` and `fileSaved` hooks only trigger for manual file operations through the IDE UI, not for programmatically created files by AI agents.

### Changes Made

**Added Hook Limitation Section**:
- Documented that hooks only trigger for manual IDE UI operations
- Explained that AI-created files don't trigger hooks
- Introduced hybrid approach: automatic for manual files, manual trigger for AI workflows

**Updated Rationale Section**:
- Modified "Hook Triggering" bullet to specify "for manual file operations"
- Added "Hybrid Approach" bullet explaining the dual-mode operation
- Clarified that automatic hooks work for manual edits, manual trigger needed for AI workflows

### Key Decisions

**Decision**: Document limitation prominently in Hook Limitation section
- **Rationale**: Makes the limitation immediately visible to readers before they read the rationale
- **Alternative**: Could have buried it in rationale, but that would be less discoverable

**Decision**: Emphasize manual trigger as standard practice for AI workflows
- **Rationale**: Sets correct expectations that manual trigger is the norm for AI-assisted development
- **Alternative**: Could have framed automatic hooks as primary, but that would mislead AI workflow users

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ Markdown formatting correct

### Functional Validation
✅ Hook limitation clearly documented
✅ Hybrid approach explained (automatic for manual files, manual for AI workflows)
✅ Rationale updated to reflect both modes of operation
✅ Manual trigger documented as standard practice for AI-assisted workflows

### Integration Validation
✅ Integrates with existing Summary Document Standards section
✅ Consistent with Development Workflow documentation updates
✅ Aligns with Spec Planning Standards updates
✅ Maintains existing cross-reference guidance

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 5.2: Summary document section updated with hook limitation
✅ Requirement 6.4: Hybrid approach documented clearly

## Requirements Compliance

**Requirement 5.2**: Update File Organization Standards with summary document metadata
- Summary Document Standards section now includes hook limitation
- Clarifies automatic hooks work for manually created/edited files only
- Documents manual trigger as standard practice for AI-assisted workflows

**Requirement 6.4**: Document hook behavior and limitations
- Hook limitation prominently documented in dedicated section
- Hybrid approach explained: automatic for manual files, manual for AI workflows
- Rationale updated to reflect both operational modes

*This task completes the File Organization Standards updates for the hook limitation documentation, ensuring developers understand when automatic hooks work and when manual triggers are required.*
