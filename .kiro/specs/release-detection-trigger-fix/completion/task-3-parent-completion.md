# Task 3 Completion: Update Development Workflow Documentation

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Task**: 3. Update Development Workflow Documentation
**Type**: Parent
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/steering/Development Workflow.md` (updated) - Added two-document workflow, manual release detection section, updated workflow diagram, enhanced troubleshooting, and added Kiro IDE file watching behavior section

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Integrate Two-Document Workflow into Existing Workflow

**Options Considered**:
1. Replace existing workflow entirely with new two-document approach
2. Add two-document workflow as separate section
3. Integrate two-document workflow into existing "Task Completion Workflow" section (chosen)

**Decision**: Integrate into existing workflow section

**Rationale**:
The two-document workflow is not a separate process but an enhancement to the existing task completion workflow. By integrating it into the "Recommended Process (IDE-based with Automation)" section, we maintain continuity with existing practices while clearly showing where the new steps fit.

The workflow already had 5 steps, and we added 2 new steps (detailed completion doc creation and summary doc creation) before the existing "Mark Task Complete" step. This makes the progression logical:
1. Complete work
2. Document comprehensively (detailed doc)
3. Document concisely (summary doc - triggers automation)
4. Mark complete
5. Commit
6. Verify

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Clear integration with existing workflow, logical step progression
- ❌ **Lost**: Could have been more prominent as separate section
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Users might miss the new steps if they're familiar with old workflow

**Counter-Arguments**:
- **Argument**: "A separate section would be more visible"
- **Response**: The workflow is numbered and clearly marked with [MANUAL] and [AUTOMATED] tags, making the new steps visible. Integration prevents duplication and confusion about which workflow to follow.

### Decision 2: Expand Troubleshooting with Detailed "Release Detection Not Triggering" Section

**Options Considered**:
1. Brief troubleshooting note referencing design document
2. Comprehensive troubleshooting section with checks and solutions (chosen)
3. Separate troubleshooting document

**Decision**: Comprehensive troubleshooting section

**Rationale**:
Release detection not triggering is the core problem this spec solves. Developers need immediate, actionable troubleshooting steps in the workflow document they're already reading. The comprehensive section provides:

- **Check 1**: Summary document creation verification
- **Check 2**: Summary document location verification (common mistake)
- **Check 3**: File naming format verification
- **Check 4**: Hook configuration verification
- **Fallback Options**: Manual trigger alternatives

This level of detail prevents developers from getting stuck and provides clear paths to resolution.

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Self-contained troubleshooting, immediate problem resolution
- ❌ **Lost**: Some duplication with design document
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Section could become outdated if hook behavior changes

**Counter-Arguments**:
- **Argument**: "This duplicates information from the design document"
- **Response**: The design document explains the architecture; the workflow document provides operational guidance. Different audiences and purposes justify the duplication.

### Decision 3: Add Dedicated "Kiro IDE File Watching Behavior" Section

**Options Considered**:
1. Brief note in troubleshooting section
2. Dedicated section explaining file watching behavior (chosen)
3. Reference to external documentation

**Decision**: Dedicated section with comprehensive explanation

**Rationale**:
The `.kiro/` directory filtering is a fundamental Kiro IDE behavior that affects multiple aspects of the workflow:
- Release detection triggering
- Hook behavior in general
- File organization automation
- Testing and validation

A dedicated section provides:
- Clear explanation of which directories trigger hooks
- Visual distinction (❌ and ✅ markers) for quick scanning
- Explanation of why this matters for release detection
- Common mistake documentation
- Design rationale for the filtering behavior

This prevents confusion and helps developers understand the underlying system behavior.

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Clear understanding of file watching behavior, prevents common mistakes
- ❌ **Lost**: Adds length to workflow document
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Could become outdated if Kiro IDE changes file watching behavior

**Counter-Arguments**:
- **Argument**: "This is Kiro IDE implementation detail, not workflow"
- **Response**: Understanding file watching behavior is essential for the workflow to work correctly. Developers need to know where to create files for hooks to trigger.

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Updated the Development Workflow documentation in five phases corresponding to the five subtasks:

1. **Phase 1 (Subtask 3.1)**: Updated "Automatic Release Detection" section with two-document workflow
2. **Phase 2 (Subtask 3.2)**: Added "Manual Release Detection" section
3. **Phase 3 (Subtask 3.3)**: Updated "Task Completion Workflow" diagram to 7 steps
4. **Phase 4 (Subtask 3.4)**: Enhanced "Release Detection Not Triggering" troubleshooting section
5. **Phase 5 (Subtask 3.5)**: Added "Kiro IDE File Watching Behavior" section

Each phase built on the previous, creating a comprehensive workflow documentation that guides developers through the new two-document approach.

### Key Patterns

**Pattern 1**: Step-by-Step Workflow with Clear Markers
- Each step numbered and marked with [MANUAL] or [AUTOMATED]
- Makes it clear which steps require human action vs automatic execution
- Helps developers understand the automation boundaries

**Pattern 2**: Comprehensive Troubleshooting with Checks
- Structured as "Check 1", "Check 2", etc. for systematic debugging
- Each check includes verification commands and solutions
- Fallback options provided when automatic detection fails

**Pattern 3**: Visual Distinction for Directory Behavior
- Used ❌ and ✅ markers to clearly show which directories trigger hooks
- Makes it easy to scan and understand file watching behavior
- Prevents common mistakes through visual clarity

## Validation (Tier 3: Comprehensive - Parent Task)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors in Development Workflow.md
✅ All markdown formatting correct
✅ Code blocks properly formatted

### Functional Validation
✅ Two-document workflow clearly explained in Task Completion Workflow section
✅ Manual release detection section provides clear instructions
✅ Workflow diagram updated to 7 steps with clear progression
✅ Troubleshooting section provides actionable checks and solutions
✅ Kiro IDE file watching behavior section explains directory filtering

### Design Validation
✅ Documentation structure supports workflow understanding
✅ Integration with existing workflow maintains continuity
✅ Troubleshooting section provides systematic problem resolution
✅ File watching behavior explanation prevents common mistakes

### System Integration
✅ Integrates with Spec Planning Standards (references summary document format)
✅ Integrates with hook system (references release-manager.sh and hook configurations)
✅ Integrates with File Organization Standards (references directory structure)
✅ Maintains consistency with existing Development Workflow patterns

### Edge Cases
✅ Documents common mistake: creating summary in `.kiro/` directory
✅ Provides fallback options when automatic detection fails
✅ Explains alternative workflow for non-spec work
✅ Addresses hook troubleshooting scenarios

### Subtask Integration
✅ Task 3.1 (automatic release detection section) integrates with Task 3.3 (workflow diagram)
✅ Task 3.2 (manual release detection) provides fallback for Task 3.1
✅ Task 3.4 (troubleshooting) references Task 3.5 (file watching behavior)
✅ Task 3.5 (file watching) explains rationale for Task 3.1 (two-document workflow)
✅ All subtasks work together to create comprehensive workflow documentation

## Success Criteria Verification

### Criterion 1: Development Workflow updated with two-document workflow

**Evidence**: Task Completion Workflow section now includes 7 steps with detailed completion document creation (step 2) and summary document creation (step 3) clearly documented.

**Verification**:
- Step 2 specifies: "Create Detailed Completion Document: For parent tasks, create comprehensive completion doc at `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/task-N-parent-completion.md` (Tier 3)"
- Step 3 specifies: "Create Summary Document: For parent tasks, create concise summary doc at `docs/specs/[spec-name]/task-N-summary.md` (triggers release detection)"
- Step 4 explains: "Release Detection: Kiro IDE detects summary document creation and triggers release detection hook automatically"
- File naming conventions documented for both types
- Rationale explained: `.kiro/` filtering and dual purpose as release notes

**Example**: Developers following the workflow will now create both detailed and summary documents, with clear understanding of why each is needed and where to create them.

### Criterion 2: Workflow diagram shows complete process including summary doc creation

**Evidence**: Task Completion Workflow section updated from 5 steps to 7 steps, with new steps 2 and 3 for detailed and summary document creation.

**Verification**:
- Original workflow had 5 steps (complete work, mark complete, commit, verify, optional manual release detection)
- Updated workflow has 7 steps with clear progression:
  1. Complete Task Work
  2. Create Detailed Completion Document (new)
  3. Create Summary Document (new - triggers automation)
  4. Release Detection (automated)
  5. Mark Task Complete
  6. Commit Changes
  7. Verify on GitHub
- Each step clearly marked with [MANUAL] or [AUTOMATED]
- Progression shows: work → document → automate → commit → verify

**Example**: The workflow diagram now shows the complete process from task completion through documentation to automation, making it clear when and how release detection triggers.

### Criterion 3: Troubleshooting section explains `.kiro/` directory filtering

**Evidence**: Added comprehensive "Kiro IDE File Watching Behavior" section and enhanced "Release Detection Not Triggering" troubleshooting section.

**Verification**:
- "Kiro IDE File Watching Behavior" section explains directory filtering
- Lists directories where hooks will NOT trigger (`.kiro/` and subdirectories)
- Lists directories where hooks WILL trigger (`docs/`, `src/`, root, etc.)
- Explains why this matters for release detection
- Documents common mistake: creating summary in `.kiro/` directory
- Provides design rationale for filtering behavior
- "Release Detection Not Triggering" section includes Check 2 specifically for summary document location

**Example**: Developers encountering release detection issues can now understand that `.kiro/` directory is filtered and summary documents must be created in `docs/specs/[spec-name]/` to trigger hooks.

## End-to-End Functionality

### Complete Workflow

The Development Workflow documentation now provides a complete workflow from task completion through documentation to automation:

1. **Task Completion**: Developer completes all task work and creates specified artifacts
2. **Detailed Documentation**: Developer creates comprehensive Tier 3 completion document in `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/` for internal knowledge preservation
3. **Summary Documentation**: Developer creates concise summary document in `docs/specs/[spec-name]/` that triggers release detection
4. **Automatic Release Detection**: Kiro IDE detects summary document creation and triggers release detection hook
5. **Task Status Update**: Developer marks task complete using taskStatus tool
6. **Commit**: Developer commits changes using commit-task.sh script
7. **Verification**: Developer verifies changes appear on GitHub

This workflow is coordinated through clear documentation that explains each step, why it's needed, and how it integrates with the overall system.

### Subtask Contributions

- Provided design rationale for filtering behavior
- Prevents confusion about where to create summary documents

### System Behavior

The Development Workflow documentation now provides comprehensive guidance for the two-document workflow that enables reliable automatic release detection. Developers understand:

- **Why two documents**: Detailed docs for internal knowledge, summary docs for automation
- **Where to create them**: Detailed in `.kiro/`, summary in `docs/` (to trigger hooks)
- **When they're needed**: For parent tasks only (subtasks use single completion doc)
- **How automation works**: Summary doc creation triggers Kiro IDE file watching → hook executes
- **What to do when it fails**: Systematic troubleshooting checks and fallback options

The documentation integrates seamlessly with existing workflow practices while introducing the new two-document approach that solves the release detection automation problem.

### User-Facing Capabilities

Developers can now:
- Follow a clear 7-step workflow for task completion with documentation
- Understand why two documents are needed and where to create them
- Rely on automatic release detection when summary documents are created correctly
- Troubleshoot systematically when release detection doesn't trigger
- Use manual fallback options when automatic detection fails
- Understand Kiro IDE file watching behavior and its implications

## Requirements Compliance

✅ Requirement 6.1: Development Workflow updated with two-document workflow explanation
✅ Requirement 6.2: Workflow diagram shows complete process including summary doc creation
✅ Requirement 6.3: Manual release detection section documents fallback trigger options
✅ Requirement 6.4: Kiro IDE file watching behavior section explains `.kiro/` directory filtering

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

- **Incremental Updates**: Updating the workflow in five phases (one per subtask) allowed for focused changes without overwhelming the document
- **Integration Approach**: Integrating the two-document workflow into existing workflow section maintained continuity and prevented confusion
- **Visual Markers**: Using [MANUAL] and [AUTOMATED] tags, plus ❌ and ✅ markers, made the documentation scannable and clear
- **Comprehensive Troubleshooting**: Providing systematic checks with verification commands and solutions enables self-service problem resolution

### Challenges

- **Balancing Detail and Brevity**: The workflow document is comprehensive, which adds length. Had to balance providing enough detail for understanding without overwhelming readers.
  - **Resolution**: Used clear section headings, visual markers, and structured checks to make the document scannable
  
- **Avoiding Duplication**: Some information overlaps with design document and Spec Planning Standards. Had to decide what to duplicate for operational guidance.
  - **Resolution**: Duplicated essential operational information (file naming, location) while referencing other documents for architectural details

- **Maintaining Consistency**: Ensuring terminology and examples matched across all sections and with other documents (Spec Planning Standards, File Organization Standards).
  - **Resolution**: Used consistent file path examples (`docs/specs/[spec-name]/task-N-summary.md`) and terminology throughout

### Future Considerations

- **Workflow Diagram Visualization**: Current workflow is text-based numbered list. Could add visual diagram (Mermaid) for better understanding
  - Would show flow from task completion → documentation → automation → commit
  - Visual representation might be clearer than numbered steps
  
- **Troubleshooting Decision Tree**: Current troubleshooting is linear checks. Could create decision tree for more efficient problem resolution
  - "Is summary doc created?" → No: Create it / Yes: Check location
  - Decision tree format might be more intuitive
  
- **Video Walkthrough**: Documentation is comprehensive but text-heavy. Video walkthrough of the workflow could help visual learners
  - Show actual process of creating detailed doc, summary doc, and seeing hook trigger
  - Demonstrate troubleshooting steps in real IDE

## Integration Points

### Dependencies

- **Spec Planning Standards**: Development Workflow references summary document format and completion documentation tiers defined in Spec Planning Standards
- **File Organization Standards**: Development Workflow references directory structure and organization metadata defined in File Organization Standards
- **Hook System**: Development Workflow references release-manager.sh script and hook configurations
- **Kiro IDE**: Development Workflow depends on Kiro IDE file watching behavior and Agent Hooks panel

### Dependents

- **Developers**: Developers depend on Development Workflow for task completion guidance
- **Future Specs**: All future specs will follow the two-document workflow documented here
- **Troubleshooting**: Developers encountering release detection issues depend on troubleshooting section
