# Task 2.3 Completion: Disable Old Hook Configurations

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Task**: 2.3 Disable old hook configurations
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Modified

- `.kiro/agent-hooks/organize-after-task-completion.json` - Disabled hook using taskStatusChange trigger
- `.kiro/agent-hooks/release-detection-on-task-completion.json` - Disabled hook using taskStatusChange trigger
- `.kiro/agent-hooks/task-completion-organization.json` - Disabled hook using taskStatus trigger

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Located all existing hook configuration files in `.kiro/agent-hooks/` directory that used unsupported trigger types (`taskStatusChange` or `taskStatus`). Rather than deleting these files, disabled them by adding `"enabled": false` and explanatory comments to preserve them as reference documentation.

### Hooks Disabled

**1. organize-after-task-completion.json**
- **Trigger Type**: `taskStatusChange` (unsupported)
- **Purpose**: Automatically organize files based on metadata after task completion
- **Reason for Disabling**: Kiro IDE only supports fileCreated, fileEdited, fileDeleted, and manual trigger types
- **Replacement**: File organization is now manual via organize-by-metadata.sh script

**2. release-detection-on-task-completion.json**
- **Trigger Type**: `taskStatusChange` (unsupported)
- **Purpose**: Automatically detect release triggers after task completion
- **Reason for Disabling**: Kiro IDE only supports fileCreated, fileEdited, fileDeleted, and manual trigger types
- **Replacement**: release-detection-auto.kiro.hook using fileCreated trigger on summary documents

**3. task-completion-organization.json**
- **Trigger Type**: `taskStatus` with condition (unsupported)
- **Purpose**: Automatically organize files when tasks are completed
- **Reason for Disabling**: Kiro IDE only supports fileCreated, fileEdited, fileDeleted, and manual trigger types
- **Replacement**: File organization is now manual via organize-by-metadata.sh script

### Comment Format

Each disabled hook includes a `_comment` field explaining:
- Why the hook was disabled (unsupported trigger type)
- What trigger types are supported by Kiro IDE
- What replaced this hook (if applicable)
- That the file is preserved for reference

### Preservation Rationale

Rather than deleting these configuration files, they were disabled and preserved because:
- They document the evolution of the hook system
- They show what was attempted before discovering trigger type limitations
- They provide reference for the configuration structure
- They help future developers understand why the approach changed

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors in JSON files
✅ All JSON files remain valid after adding enabled and _comment fields
✅ No compilation errors

### Functional Validation
✅ All three hooks with unsupported trigger types identified
✅ Each hook disabled with `"enabled": false` field
✅ Explanatory comments added to each hook configuration
✅ Files preserved rather than deleted for reference

### Integration Validation
✅ Hook configurations remain valid JSON structure
✅ Comments clearly explain why hooks were disabled
✅ References to replacement hooks included where applicable
✅ No impact on new .kiro.hook format files

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 1.6: Old hook configurations with unsupported trigger types disabled
✅ Files preserved for reference rather than deleted
✅ Clear explanations added for why hooks were disabled
✅ All hooks using taskStatusChange or taskStatus triggers addressed

## Requirements Compliance

**Requirement 1.6**: WHEN the hook configuration is updated THEN it SHALL NOT include `runAfter` dependencies (no file organization dependency)

This task addresses the broader requirement of fixing hooks that use unsupported trigger types. The old hooks have been disabled because:
- They use `taskStatusChange` trigger type which is not supported by Kiro IDE
- They attempted to trigger on task status changes which doesn't work
- They have been replaced by new hooks using supported trigger types (fileCreated, manual)

The new hook system (release-detection-auto.kiro.hook and release-detection-manual.kiro.hook) does not include `runAfter` dependencies, as file organization is now manual rather than automated.

*This task completes the cleanup of old hook configurations, ensuring that only hooks with supported trigger types remain active in the system.*
