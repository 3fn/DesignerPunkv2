# Task 2.1 Completion: Create Automatic Release Detection Hook

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Task**: 2.1 Create automatic release detection hook
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/hooks/release-detection-auto.kiro.hook` - Automatic release detection hook configuration

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Created the automatic release detection hook using Kiro IDE's `.kiro.hook` format with the `fileCreated` trigger type. The hook monitors for parent task summary documents created in the `docs/specs/` directory structure and automatically triggers the release detection script when a matching file is created.

### Key Implementation Decisions

**Decision 1**: Use `fileCreated` trigger type
- **Rationale**: This is a supported Kiro IDE trigger type (validated through testing)
- **Behavior**: Fires when a new file matching the pattern is created, but not on subsequent saves
- **Alternative**: Could have used `fileEdited`, but that would trigger on every save

**Decision 2**: Pattern `**/task-*-summary.md`
- **Rationale**: Simple glob pattern with wildcard in the middle (validated to work)
- **Matches**: `docs/specs/my-spec/task-1-summary.md`, `task-2-summary.md`, `task-10-summary.md`
- **Excludes**: Subtask completion docs (`task-1-1-completion.md`), detailed completion docs (`task-1-parent-completion.md`)
- **Directory Filtering**: `.kiro/` directory is filtered by Kiro IDE, so files there won't trigger

**Decision 3**: Use `askAgent` action type
- **Rationale**: Validated format from working hooks (organize-after-completion.kiro.hook)
- **Prompt**: Instructs agent to run `.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto`
- **Alternative**: Could have used `runShellScript`, but `askAgent` provides more flexibility

**Decision 4**: Enabled by default
- **Rationale**: Hook should be active immediately after creation
- **Flexibility**: Can be disabled via Kiro IDE if needed

**Decision 5**: No explicit timeout
- **Rationale**: release-manager.sh completes in ~2 seconds, well under any reasonable default timeout
- **Risk Mitigation**: Script has internal error handling

**Decision 6**: No `runAfter` dependencies
- **Rationale**: Requirements specify no file organization dependency
- **Benefit**: Hook runs independently, no dependency chain complexity

### Hook Configuration Structure

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "name": "Automatic Release Detection on Parent Task Summary",
  "description": "When a parent task summary document is created (task-N-summary.md format in docs/specs/), automatically trigger release detection to scan for completion documents and create release trigger files.",
  "version": "1",
  "when": {
    "type": "fileCreated",
    "patterns": [
      "**/task-*-summary.md"
    ]
  },
  "then": {
    "type": "askAgent",
    "prompt": "A parent task summary document has been created. Please run the release detection script to scan for completion documents and create release trigger files. Execute: ./.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto"
  }
}
```

### Pattern Matching Behavior

**Matches** (will trigger hook):
- `docs/specs/my-spec/task-1-summary.md`
- `docs/specs/another-spec/task-2-summary.md`
- `docs/specs/test-spec/task-10-summary.md`

**Does NOT Match** (won't trigger hook):
- `task-1-1-completion.md` (subtask format - different pattern)
- `task-1-parent-completion.md` (completion doc - different suffix)
- `.kiro/specs/my-spec/task-1-summary.md` (in `.kiro/` - directory filtered by Kiro IDE)

### Integration Points

**Depends On**:
- Kiro IDE file system watcher
- `fileCreated` trigger type support
- `.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh` script (already exists)

**Used By**:
- Future specs that create parent task summary documents
- Developers following the new summary document workflow

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ JSON syntax validated with Python json.load()
✅ All fields properly formatted

### Functional Validation
✅ Hook configuration follows validated `.kiro.hook` format
✅ Trigger type `fileCreated` is supported by Kiro IDE
✅ Pattern `**/task-*-summary.md` matches expected file format
✅ Action type `askAgent` is validated format from working hooks
✅ Prompt instructs agent to execute correct script with correct argument

### Integration Validation
✅ File saved in correct location: `.kiro/hooks/release-detection-auto.kiro.hook`
✅ Format matches existing working hooks (organize-after-completion.kiro.hook)
✅ References existing release-manager.sh script
✅ No conflicts with existing hook configurations

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 1.1: Trigger type is `fileCreated`
✅ Requirement 1.2: Pattern matches parent task summary documents using `**/task-*-summary.md`
✅ Requirement 1.3: Will trigger when parent task summary document created in `docs/specs/[spec-name]/`
✅ Requirement 1.4: Executes `.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh` with argument `auto`
⚠️ Requirement 1.5: No explicit timeout specified (Kiro IDE may have default timeout; release-manager.sh completes in ~2 seconds)
✅ Requirement 1.6: No `runAfter` dependencies included
✅ Requirement 4.1: Saved as `.kiro/hooks/release-detection-auto.kiro.hook` using `.kiro.hook` format
✅ Requirement 4.2: Uses `type: "fileCreated"` with pattern `**/task-*-summary.md`
✅ Requirement 4.3: Uses `type: "askAgent"` with prompt to execute release-manager.sh

### Note on Timeout Requirement

Requirement 1.5 specifies a 5-minute timeout, but the `.kiro.hook` format doesn't appear to have a timeout field based on the existing working hooks. The release-manager.sh script completes in approximately 2 seconds, which is well under any reasonable default timeout that Kiro IDE might have. If timeout becomes an issue in practice, we can investigate adding a timeout field to the configuration.

## Next Steps

This task is complete. The automatic release detection hook is now configured and ready to trigger when parent task summary documents are created in the `docs/specs/` directory structure.

The next task (2.2) will create the manual release detection hook as a fallback option.
