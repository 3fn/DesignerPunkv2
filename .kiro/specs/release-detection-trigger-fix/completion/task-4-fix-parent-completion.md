# Task 4.FIX Completion: Document Hook Limitation and Hybrid Approach

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Task**: 4.FIX Document Hook Limitation and Hybrid Approach
**Type**: Parent
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Modified

- `.kiro/steering/Spec Planning Standards.md` - Updated with manual trigger requirement and hook limitation
- `.kiro/steering/Development Workflow.md` - Updated with hook limitation explanation and hybrid approach
- `.kiro/steering/File Organization Standards.md` - Updated with hook limitation and hybrid approach clarification

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Document Hybrid Approach Rather Than Remove Automatic Hooks

**Options Considered**:
1. Remove automatic hook documentation entirely (only document manual trigger)
2. Keep automatic hook documentation but mark as deprecated
3. Document hybrid approach with both automatic and manual triggers (chosen)

**Decision**: Document hybrid approach with both automatic and manual triggers

**Rationale**: 
Automatic hooks still provide value for developers who manually create summary documents through the IDE UI. Removing this documentation would eliminate a useful workflow for manual file operations. The hybrid approach acknowledges both use cases:
- Manual file operations through IDE UI → automatic hooks work
- AI-assisted programmatic file creation → manual trigger required

This provides flexibility while setting correct expectations about when each approach applies.

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Supports both manual and AI-assisted workflows
- ✅ **Gained**: Preserves value of automatic hooks for manual operations
- ✅ **Gained**: Clear guidance on when to use each approach
- ❌ **Lost**: Slightly more complex documentation (two approaches instead of one)
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Developers might be confused about which approach to use

**Counter-Arguments**:
- **Argument**: "Having two approaches is confusing - just pick one"
- **Response**: The two approaches serve different workflows (manual vs AI-assisted). Documenting only one would leave the other workflow without guidance.

### Decision 2: Add "Release Detection Triggered" to Success Criteria

**Options Considered**:
1. Leave success criteria unchanged (implicit that release detection should happen)
2. Add "Release detection triggered" to success criteria (chosen)
3. Add detailed release detection steps to success criteria

**Decision**: Add "Release detection triggered" to success criteria

**Rationale**:
Making release detection an explicit success criterion ensures developers don't forget this step in AI-assisted workflows. The criterion is concise but clear - it doesn't prescribe how to trigger release detection (automatic vs manual), just that it must happen.

This addresses the root cause of the issue: developers completing tasks without triggering release detection because it wasn't explicitly required.

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Explicit requirement prevents forgotten release detection
- ✅ **Gained**: Concise criterion doesn't add excessive detail
- ✅ **Gained**: Works for both automatic and manual trigger approaches
- ❌ **Lost**: Adds one more item to success criteria checklist

**Counter-Arguments**:
- **Argument**: "This should be implicit - developers should know to trigger release detection"
- **Response**: The fact that this issue arose shows it's not implicit enough. Explicit is better than implicit for critical workflow steps.

### Decision 3: Add Post-Completion Step with Manual Trigger Command

**Options Considered**:
1. Document manual trigger in separate section only
2. Add post-completion step to parent task format (chosen)
3. Add manual trigger to every subtask

**Decision**: Add post-completion step to parent task format

**Rationale**:
Placing the manual trigger command in a "Post-Completion" section of the parent task format provides clear, actionable guidance exactly when developers need it - right after completing the task. The command is copy-pasteable, reducing friction.

This is more effective than documenting the command elsewhere because developers see it in context while working on the task.

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Command visible in task context
- ✅ **Gained**: Copy-pasteable command reduces errors
- ✅ **Gained**: Clear timing (post-completion)
- ❌ **Lost**: Adds section to parent task format

**Counter-Arguments**:
- **Argument**: "This clutters the task format with implementation details"
- **Response**: This is a critical workflow step, not an implementation detail. It's as important as the completion documentation paths.

## Implementation Details

### Overall Approach

Updated three key documentation files to reflect the hook limitation discovered during Task 4 completion. The updates follow a consistent pattern:

1. **Document the limitation**: Explain that hooks only trigger for manual IDE UI operations
2. **Introduce hybrid approach**: Automatic for manual files, manual trigger for AI workflows
3. **Provide clear guidance**: Specific commands and workflow steps
4. **Update examples**: Show the new requirements in context

### Subtask Integration

**Task 4.FIX.1**: Updated Spec Planning Standards
- Added hook limitation section to Parent Task Summary Documents
- Updated success criteria to include "Release detection triggered"
- Added post-completion step with manual trigger command
- Updated parent task format examples (Example 1 and Example 5)

**Task 4.FIX.2**: Updated Development Workflow
- Added hook limitation explanation to "Automatic Release Detection" section
- Updated "Task Completion Workflow" to include manual trigger step
- Added "Hybrid Approach - When Hooks Trigger" subsection with examples
- Emphasized manual trigger as standard practice for AI-assisted workflows

**Task 4.FIX.3**: Updated File Organization Standards
- Added hook limitation to Summary Document Standards section
- Updated rationale to include "Hybrid Approach" bullet
- Clarified automatic hooks work for manually created/edited files only
- Documented manual trigger as standard practice for AI-assisted workflows

### Key Implementation Patterns

**Pattern 1**: Hook Limitation Notice
All three documents include a prominent "Hook Limitation" section that explains:
- Hooks only trigger for manual IDE UI operations
- AI-created files don't trigger hooks
- Hybrid approach required

**Pattern 2**: Hybrid Approach Explanation
All three documents explain the dual-mode operation:
- Automatic hooks for manual file operations
- Manual trigger for AI-assisted workflows

**Pattern 3**: Standard Practice Emphasis
All three documents emphasize that manual trigger is the standard practice for AI-assisted workflows, setting correct expectations.

## Success Criteria Verification

### Criterion 1: Spec Planning Standards updated with manual trigger in parent task success criteria

**Evidence**: Spec Planning Standards now includes:
- "Release detection triggered" in success criteria examples
- Post-completion step: "Run `./.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto`"
- Hook limitation documented in Parent Task Summary Documents section
- Updated parent task format examples (Example 1 and Example 5)

**Verification**:
- ✅ Success criteria includes "Release detection triggered"
- ✅ Post-completion step provides exact command
- ✅ Hook limitation explained clearly
- ✅ Examples updated consistently

**Example**: 
From Example 1 in Spec Planning Standards:
```markdown
**Success Criteria:**
- Build system foundation established with clear architecture
- Platform-specific generation working for web, iOS, and Android
- Error handling comprehensive across all components
- Release detection triggered

**Post-Completion:**
- Run `./.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto` to trigger release detection
```

### Criterion 2: Development Workflow updated with hook limitation explanation and hybrid approach

**Evidence**: Development Workflow now includes:
- Hook limitation explanation in "Automatic Release Detection" section
- "Hybrid Approach - When Hooks Trigger" subsection with examples
- Updated "Task Completion Workflow" with manual trigger step
- Emphasis on manual trigger as standard practice for AI-assisted workflows

**Verification**:
- ✅ Hook limitation documented prominently
- ✅ Hybrid approach explained with clear examples
- ✅ Workflow steps include manual trigger
- ✅ Standard practice emphasized for AI workflows

**Example**:
From "Task Completion Workflow" section:
```markdown
4. **[MANUAL - AI Workflows]** **Trigger Release Detection**: Run `./.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto` (required for AI-created files; automatic hooks only work for manual IDE file operations)
5. **[AUTOMATED - Manual Files]** **Release Detection**: Kiro IDE detects summary document creation and triggers release detection hook automatically (only for manually created files through IDE UI)
```

### Criterion 3: File Organization Standards updated with clarification about when hooks trigger

**Evidence**: File Organization Standards now includes:
- Hook limitation in Summary Document Standards section
- Hybrid approach in rationale
- Clarification that automatic hooks work for manually created/edited files only
- Manual trigger documented as standard practice for AI-assisted workflows

**Verification**:
- ✅ Hook limitation section added
- ✅ Rationale updated with hybrid approach
- ✅ Clear distinction between manual and AI-created files
- ✅ Standard practice documented

**Example**:
From Summary Document Standards section:
```markdown
**Hook Limitation**: Kiro IDE's `fileCreated` and `fileSaved` hooks only trigger for **manual file operations through the IDE UI**, not for programmatically created files by AI agents. This requires a hybrid approach:
- **Automatic hooks**: Work for manually created/edited files through IDE UI
- **Manual trigger**: Required for AI-assisted workflows after summary document creation
```

### Criterion 4: Hook limitation documented clearly across all three documents

**Evidence**: All three documents include consistent hook limitation documentation:
- Spec Planning Standards: Hook limitation in Parent Task Summary Documents section
- Development Workflow: Hook limitation in Automatic Release Detection section
- File Organization Standards: Hook limitation in Summary Document Standards section

**Verification**:
- ✅ All three documents updated
- ✅ Consistent messaging across documents
- ✅ Hook limitation explained clearly in each context
- ✅ Hybrid approach documented in all three files

## Overall Integration Story

### Complete Workflow

The hook limitation documentation creates a complete workflow for both manual and AI-assisted development:

**Manual File Creation Workflow**:
1. Developer completes parent task work
2. Developer creates detailed completion document in `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/`
3. Developer manually creates summary document in `docs/specs/[spec-name]/` through IDE UI
4. Kiro IDE detects file creation and triggers automatic release detection hook
5. Release manager scans for completion documents and creates trigger files

**AI-Assisted Workflow**:
1. AI agent completes parent task work
2. AI agent creates detailed completion document in `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/`
3. AI agent creates summary document in `docs/specs/[spec-name]/` programmatically
4. Developer manually runs `./.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto` to trigger release detection
5. Release manager scans for completion documents and creates trigger files

### Subtask Contributions

**Task 4.FIX.1**: Spec Planning Standards
- Established manual trigger as explicit success criterion
- Provided post-completion step with exact command
- Updated parent task format examples to show new requirements
- Documented hook limitation in context of summary documents

**Task 4.FIX.2**: Development Workflow
- Explained hook limitation in workflow context
- Updated workflow steps to include manual trigger
- Provided hybrid approach examples showing when hooks trigger

**Task 4.FIX.3**: File Organization Standards
- Documented hook limitation in organizational context
- Updated rationale to reflect hybrid approach
- Clarified when automatic hooks work vs when manual trigger needed
- Integrated with existing summary document standards

### System Behavior

The documentation now provides clear guidance for both workflows:
- Developers know when automatic hooks will work (manual IDE operations)
- Developers know when manual trigger is required (AI-assisted workflows)
- Both workflows are documented as valid approaches
- Manual trigger is emphasized as standard practice for AI-assisted development

### User-Facing Capabilities

Developers can now:
- Understand why automatic hooks don't work for AI-created files
- Know exactly when to use manual trigger vs automatic hooks
- Follow clear workflow steps for both manual and AI-assisted development
- Copy-paste the exact command needed for manual trigger
- Trust that release detection will work in both scenarios

## Requirements Compliance

✅ Requirement 3.1: Added "Release detection triggered" to parent task success criteria
✅ Requirement 3.2: Added post-completion step with manual trigger command
✅ Requirement 6.1: Documented hybrid approach (automatic for manual edits, manual for AI workflows)
✅ Requirement 6.2: Updated workflow steps to include manual trigger after summary doc creation
✅ Requirement 6.4: Clarified hooks only trigger for manual file saves through IDE UI
✅ Requirement 6.4: Emphasized manual trigger as standard practice for AI-assisted workflows
