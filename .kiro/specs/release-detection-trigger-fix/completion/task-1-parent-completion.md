# Task 1 Completion: Update Spec Planning Standards with Summary Document Workflow

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Task**: 1. Update Spec Planning Standards with Summary Document Workflow
**Type**: Parent
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/steering/Spec Planning Standards.md` (updated) - Added Parent Task Summary Documents section with format template and cross-reference guidance

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Location of Summary Document Section

**Options Considered**:
1. Add section at the end of the document
2. Add section after "Documentation Best Practices"
3. Add section within the "Three-Tier Completion Documentation System"

**Decision**: Add section after "Documentation Best Practices"

**Rationale**: 
The "Documentation Best Practices" section is the natural conclusion of the completion documentation guidance. Placing the summary document section immediately after it creates a logical flow: general best practices → specific summary document workflow. This placement makes it easy for developers to find when they're looking for completion documentation guidance.

Additionally, this location is before the "Spec Workflow" section, which means developers will encounter the summary document guidance before they start implementing tasks, helping them understand the complete workflow upfront.

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Logical flow from general to specific documentation practices
- ✅ **Gained**: Easy discoverability near related completion documentation content
- ❌ **Lost**: Not integrated within the Three-Tier system (but this is intentional - summaries are a separate concern)

**Counter-Arguments**:
- **Argument**: "Should be within Three-Tier Completion Documentation System since it's about completion docs"
- **Response**: Summary documents serve a different purpose (hook triggering + release notes) than the detailed completion docs (knowledge preservation). Keeping them separate clarifies this distinction.

### Decision 2: Cross-Reference Guidance Placement

**Options Considered**:
1. Create separate section for cross-reference guidance
2. Include cross-reference guidance within the summary document section
3. Add cross-reference guidance to File Organization Standards instead

**Decision**: Include cross-reference guidance within the summary document section

**Rationale**:
Cross-references between summary and detailed docs are a core part of the summary document workflow. Including the guidance in the same section ensures developers see it when they're learning about summary documents. The guidance is specific to this two-document pattern, so it belongs with the summary document documentation rather than in general file organization standards.

The placement also provides immediate, actionable guidance on how to create the cross-references when developers are creating summary documents.

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: All summary document guidance in one place
- ✅ **Gained**: Immediate actionable guidance when creating summaries
- ❌ **Lost**: Some duplication with File Organization Standards (but minimal)

**Counter-Arguments**:
- **Argument**: "Cross-reference guidance should be in File Organization Standards for consistency"
- **Response**: While File Organization Standards has general cross-reference patterns, this specific guidance is unique to the summary/detailed doc relationship and belongs with the summary document workflow.

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Updated the Spec Planning Standards document in three phases corresponding to the three subtasks:

1. **Added Summary Document Section** (Subtask 1.1): Created a comprehensive section explaining the purpose, location, format, and rationale for parent task summary documents. Included a complete format template with example.

2. **Updated Task Format Examples** (Subtask 1.2): Modified the existing task format examples to show both detailed and summary documentation paths in the "Completion Documentation" field, making it clear that parent tasks require two documents.

3. **Added Cross-Reference Guidance** (Subtask 1.3): Documented how to create bidirectional links between summary and detailed docs, including relative path calculations and best practices.

### Key Patterns

**Pattern 1**: Two-Document Workflow
- Detailed completion docs in `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/` for comprehensive knowledge preservation
- Summary docs in `docs/specs/[spec-name]/` for hook triggering and release notes
- Clear separation of concerns: internal vs public-facing documentation

**Pattern 2**: Relative Path Cross-References
- Summary to detailed: `../../.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/task-N-parent-completion.md`
- Detailed to summary: `../../../docs/specs/[spec-name]/task-N-summary.md`
- Explicit path calculation guidance to prevent broken links

**Pattern 3**: Forward-Looking Application
- Applies to new specs only, no migration needed
- Existing completion docs remain unchanged
- Clean transition without disrupting current work

## Validation (Tier 3: Comprehensive - Parent Task)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors in Spec Planning Standards.md
✅ All markdown formatting correct
✅ Code blocks properly formatted

### Functional Validation
✅ Summary document section provides complete workflow guidance
✅ Format template includes all required sections
✅ Cross-reference guidance includes working relative path examples
✅ Task format examples clearly show both documentation types

### Design Validation
✅ Section placement creates logical flow (best practices → summary workflow)
✅ Two-document pattern clearly explained with rationale
✅ Cross-reference guidance is actionable and specific
✅ Forward-looking approach avoids migration complexity

### System Integration
✅ Integrates with existing Three-Tier Completion Documentation System
✅ Aligns with File Organization Standards (summary docs in docs/, detailed in .kiro/)
✅ Supports Development Workflow automation (hook triggering)
✅ Compatible with existing task format structure

### Edge Cases
✅ Handles relative path calculation from different source locations
✅ Provides guidance for optional detailed-to-summary links
✅ Explains why .kiro/ directory filtering matters
✅ Clarifies forward-looking application (no migration needed)

### Subtask Integration
✅ Subtask 1.1 (summary section) provides foundation for 1.2 and 1.3
✅ Subtask 1.2 (task examples) demonstrates the workflow in practice
✅ Subtask 1.3 (cross-references) completes the two-document pattern
✅ All three subtasks work together to create complete guidance

## Success Criteria Verification

### Criterion 1: Spec Planning Standards updated with summary document section and format template

**Evidence**: Added comprehensive "Parent Task Summary Documents" section after "Documentation Best Practices" with complete format template.

**Verification**:
- Section includes purpose, location, when to create, and rationale
- Format template has all required sections: What Was Done, Why It Matters, Key Changes, Impact
- Example summary document provided for reference
- Forward-looking note explains application to new specs only

**Example**: The format template provides a complete structure that developers can copy and adapt for their own summary documents.

### Criterion 2: Task format examples show both detailed and summary documentation

**Evidence**: Updated all task format examples to include both documentation paths in "Completion Documentation" field.

**Verification**:
- Parent task examples show: `Detailed: .kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/task-N-parent-completion.md`
- Parent task examples show: `Summary: docs/specs/[spec-name]/task-N-summary.md (triggers release detection)`
- Format is consistent across all examples
- Clear indication that summary docs trigger release detection

**Example**: Example 1 (Build System Foundation) demonstrates the complete format with both documentation types.

### Criterion 3: Clear distinction between internal (detailed) and public (summary) documentation

**Evidence**: Rationale section explicitly explains the separation of concerns and dual purpose of summary documents.

**Verification**:
- Rationale explains .kiro/ directory filtering (why summaries are needed)
- Dual purpose clearly stated: hook triggering + release note content
- Clear separation: detailed (internal knowledge) vs summary (public-facing)
- Cross-reference guidance maintains this distinction

**Example**: The rationale section states: "Detailed completion docs (internal knowledge preservation) remain in `.kiro/`, while summaries (public-facing) live in `docs/`."

## Overall Integration Story

### Complete Workflow

The updated Spec Planning Standards now provides complete guidance for the two-document workflow:

1. **Complete Parent Task**: Developer finishes all subtasks and validates integration
2. **Create Detailed Completion Doc**: Write comprehensive Tier 3 documentation in `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/task-N-parent-completion.md`
3. **Create Summary Document**: Write concise summary in `docs/specs/[spec-name]/task-N-summary.md`
4. **Cross-Reference**: Add links between summary and detailed docs
5. **Automatic Hook Trigger**: Summary doc creation triggers release detection hook
6. **Release Analysis**: System processes completion and creates release triggers

This workflow enables automatic release detection while maintaining comprehensive internal documentation.

### Subtask Contributions

**Subtask 1.1**: Add summary document section
- Established the foundation with purpose, location, and format template
- Explained rationale for two-document approach
- Provided forward-looking note about application

**Subtask 1.2**: Update task format examples
- Demonstrated the workflow in practice with concrete examples
- Showed how to reference both documentation types in tasks.md
- Made the two-document pattern visible in task planning

**Subtask 1.3**: Add cross-reference guidance
- Completed the two-document pattern with bidirectional linking
- Provided relative path calculations for different source locations
- Included best practices for maintaining cross-references

### System Behavior

The Spec Planning Standards now provides developers with:

1. **Clear Workflow**: Step-by-step guidance on creating both documentation types
2. **Format Templates**: Ready-to-use templates for summary documents
3. **Cross-Reference Patterns**: Specific guidance on linking between documents
4. **Rationale**: Understanding of why two documents are needed
5. **Examples**: Concrete examples demonstrating the workflow

### User-Facing Capabilities

Developers can now:
- Understand the two-document workflow for parent tasks
- Create summary documents that trigger release detection hooks
- Maintain comprehensive internal documentation in .kiro/
- Cross-reference between summary and detailed docs
- Apply the workflow to new specs without migrating existing work

## Requirements Compliance

✅ Requirement 3.1: Parent task summary documents use naming format `task-[N]-summary.md` in `docs/specs/[spec-name]/` directory
✅ Requirement 3.2: Naming convention explains distinction between detailed completion docs and summary docs
✅ Requirement 3.3: Examples show `task-1-summary.md`, `task-2-summary.md`, `task-10-summary.md`
✅ Requirement 3.4: Standard notes this is forward-looking (existing completion docs don't need migration)
✅ Requirement 5.1: Completion documentation section specifies two types: detailed (`.kiro/`) and summary (`docs/`)
✅ Requirement 5.2: Examples show both documentation types with clear distinction
✅ Requirement 5.6: Summary document format includes template with required sections

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

- **Logical Section Placement**: Placing the summary document section after "Documentation Best Practices" created natural flow
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Including complete format template and example made the guidance immediately actionable
- **Relative Path Guidance**: Explicit path calculations prevent common mistakes with cross-references
- **Forward-Looking Approach**: Avoiding migration complexity by applying only to new specs

### Challenges

- **Balancing Detail**: Needed to provide enough detail for clarity without overwhelming developers
  - **Resolution**: Used format template and example to show rather than just tell
- **Cross-Reference Complexity**: Relative paths can be confusing from different source locations
  - **Resolution**: Provided explicit path calculations with breakdown of each step

### Future Considerations

- **Validation**: Could add validation to check that parent tasks have both documentation types
- **Automation**: Could create template files or scripts to generate summary doc structure
- **Metrics**: Could track adoption of summary document workflow in new specs

## Integration Points

### Dependencies

- **File Organization Standards**: Summary docs follow organization metadata patterns
- **Development Workflow**: Summary docs trigger release detection hooks
- **Three-Tier Completion Documentation**: Detailed docs follow Tier 3 comprehensive format

### Dependents

- **Future Specs**: All new specs will use two-document workflow for parent tasks
- **Release Detection System**: Depends on summary docs being created in docs/ directory
- **Hook System**: Depends on summary doc naming pattern for triggering

### Extension Points

- **Template Generation**: Could add tooling to generate summary doc templates
- **Validation Rules**: Could add checks to ensure both docs are created
- **Cross-Reference Automation**: Could automate cross-reference link creation

### API Surface

**Summary Document Format**:
- Required sections: What Was Done, Why It Matters, Key Changes, Impact
- Metadata: Date, Spec, Type
- Cross-reference: Link to detailed completion doc

**Cross-Reference Patterns**:
- Summary to detailed: `../../.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/task-N-parent-completion.md`
- Detailed to summary: `../../../docs/specs/[spec-name]/task-N-summary.md`
- Tasks.md reference: Both paths listed in "Completion Documentation" field
