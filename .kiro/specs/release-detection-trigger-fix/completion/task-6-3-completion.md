## Artifacts Removed

### Root Directory Test Files
- `test-hook-trigger-test.md` - Test file for hook triggering (removed)
- `test-hook-example.md` - Not found (already removed)
- `test-hook-trigger-2.md` - Not found (already removed)
- `test-parent-completion.md` - Not found (already removed)

### Release Detection Trigger Fix Test Files
- `docs/specs/release-detection-trigger-fix/task-filesave-test-summary.md` - Test summary for file save hook testing (removed)
- `docs/specs/release-detection-trigger-fix/task-test-2-summary.md` - Test summary file (removed)
- `docs/specs/release-detection-trigger-fix/task-test-summary.md` - Test summary file (removed)
- `docs/specs/release-detection-trigger-fix/task-test2-summary.md` - Test summary file (removed)

### Test Spec Directory
- `docs/specs/test-spec/` - Directory not found (already removed or never created)

## Implementation Notes

Cleaned up all test markdown files created during hook validation testing (Task 5). Most root directory test files had already been removed in previous cleanup tasks (6.1 and 6.2). Found and removed four test summary files from the release-detection-trigger-fix spec directory that were created during hook trigger testing.

The test-spec directory was not found, indicating it was either never created or already cleaned up in a previous task.

## Validation (Tier 1: Minimal)

### Artifact Verification
✅ Verified `test-hook-trigger-test.md` removed from root directory
✅ Verified `test-hook-example.md` not present (already removed)
✅ Verified `test-hook-trigger-2.md` not present (already removed)
✅ Verified `test-parent-completion.md` not present (already removed)
✅ Verified all test summary files removed from `docs/specs/release-detection-trigger-fix/`
✅ Verified `docs/specs/test-spec/` directory not present

### File System Validation
✅ No test markdown files remain in root directory
✅ No test summary files remain in release-detection-trigger-fix spec directory
✅ Repository clean of test artifacts

## Requirements Compliance

✅ Requirement 7.1: Test files removed to clean up repository after validation testing
