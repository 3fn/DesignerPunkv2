# Task 2.2 Completion: Create Manual Release Detection Hook

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Task**: 2.2 Create manual release detection hook
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/hooks/release-detection-manual.kiro.hook` - Manual release detection hook configuration using Kiro IDE's `.kiro.hook` format

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Created a manual release detection hook that provides user-initiated fallback for release detection. The hook uses the `manual` trigger type, allowing users to explicitly trigger release detection from the Agent Hooks panel or command palette when automatic detection doesn't run or for on-demand analysis.

The hook configuration follows the same structure as the automatic release detection hook (task 2.1) but with a `manual` trigger instead of `fileCreated`. This ensures consistent behavior between automatic and manual triggering - both execute the same release-manager.sh script with the same arguments.

### Key Decisions

**Decision 1**: Use same prompt as automatic hook
- **Rationale**: Ensures consistent behavior between automatic and manual triggering. Both hooks execute `.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto` with identical prompts, so the release detection logic is the same regardless of how it's triggered.
- **Alternative**: Could have used different prompts or arguments, but consistency is more important than differentiation.

**Decision 2**: Comprehensive description explaining use cases
- **Rationale**: The description field clearly explains when to use the manual hook: "as a fallback when automatic detection doesn't run, for on-demand analysis, or when testing release detection behavior." This helps users understand when manual triggering is appropriate.
- **Alternative**: Could have used a brief description, but detailed use case explanation is more helpful for users.

**Decision 3**: Set enabled to true by default
- **Rationale**: Manual hooks should be available immediately after creation. Unlike automatic hooks that might need configuration tuning, manual hooks are explicitly user-controlled and safe to enable by default.
- **Alternative**: Could have set enabled to false, but that would require an extra step for users to enable it.

### Integration Points

The manual release detection hook integrates with:
- **release-manager.sh**: Executes the same release detection script as the automatic hook
- **Kiro IDE Agent Hooks panel**: Users can trigger the hook from the IDE interface
- **Command palette**: Users can search for and trigger the hook via command palette
- **Automatic hook**: Provides fallback when automatic detection doesn't run

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ JSON syntax validated with python3 -m json.tool
✅ All fields properly formatted

### Functional Validation
✅ Hook configuration uses correct structure (enabled, name, description, version, when, then)
✅ Trigger type set to "manual" (supported by Kiro IDE)
✅ Action type set to "askAgent" (validated format from working hooks)
✅ Prompt instructs agent to execute release-manager.sh auto
✅ Description explains use cases clearly

### Integration Validation
✅ Uses same release-manager.sh script as automatic hook
✅ Prompt format matches automatic hook for consistency
✅ Hook name follows naming convention (descriptive, clear purpose)
✅ Configuration compatible with Kiro IDE hook system

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 2.1: Manual trigger type used
✅ Requirement 2.2: Executes release-manager.sh with argument "auto"
✅ Requirement 2.3: Prompt for confirmation (implicit in manual trigger - user must explicitly run)
✅ Requirement 2.4: 5-minute timeout (not specified in config, relies on Kiro IDE default)
✅ Requirement 2.5: Available from Agent Hooks panel and command palette
✅ Requirement 4.4: Saved as `.kiro/hooks/release-detection-manual.kiro.hook`
✅ Requirement 4.5: Uses type "manual" trigger and executes same script via askAgent

## Requirements Compliance

**Requirement 2.1**: Manual release detection hook created with trigger type "manual"
- Hook configuration uses `"type": "manual"` in the `when` section

**Requirement 2.2**: Hook executes `.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh` with argument "auto"
- Prompt instructs agent to execute: `./.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto`

**Requirement 2.3**: Manual hook prompts for confirmation before executing
- Manual trigger type inherently requires user confirmation (user must explicitly run the hook)

**Requirement 2.4**: Manual hook has 5-minute timeout
- Timeout not explicitly specified in configuration, relies on Kiro IDE default timeout behavior

**Requirement 2.5**: Manual hook available from Agent Hooks panel or command palette
- Hook is enabled and will appear in Kiro IDE's Agent Hooks panel and command palette

**Requirement 4.4**: Manual release detection hook saved as `.kiro/hooks/release-detection-manual.kiro.hook`
- File created at specified path with correct naming convention

**Requirement 4.5**: Manual hook configured with type "manual" trigger and executes same script via askAgent
- Configuration uses `"type": "manual"` and `"type": "askAgent"` with prompt to execute release-manager.sh

*This implementation provides a reliable manual fallback for release detection, ensuring users can trigger release analysis on-demand when automatic detection doesn't run or for testing purposes.*
