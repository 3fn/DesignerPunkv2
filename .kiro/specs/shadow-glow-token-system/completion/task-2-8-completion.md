# Task 2.8 Completion: Update Requirements Document with Shadow Color Family Acceptance Criteria

**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Task**: 2.8 Update requirements document with shadow color family acceptance criteria
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Modified

- `.kiro/specs/shadow-glow-token-system/requirements.md` - Updated Requirement 1.4 acceptance criteria and documentation

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Updated Requirement 1 (Shadow Primitive Token Foundation) in the requirements document to reflect the shadow color family architecture implemented in previous tasks. The update changes from purpose-based naming (shadowDefault, shadowWarm, shadowCool, shadowAmbient) to systematic color family structure (shadowBlack100, shadowBlue100, shadowOrange100, shadowGray100).

### Changes Made

**Acceptance Criteria Updates**:
1. Updated criterion 4 to reference shadow color family structure (shadowBlack100, shadowBlue100, shadowOrange100, shadowGray100)
2. Added new criterion 5 to document semantic mapping (shadowBlack100 → color.shadow.default, etc.)

**Documentation Enhancements**:
1. Added "Shadow Color Family Architecture" section explaining:
   - Architectural consistency with existing color system
   - Systematic structure with numeric scale
   - Future flexibility for additional variants
   - Clear family relationships

2. Added "Art Theory Rationale" section documenting:
   - shadowBlack100: Pure black for neutral lighting
   - shadowBlue100: Cool blue-gray for warm lighting (sunrise/sunset)
   - shadowOrange100: Warm orange-gray for cool lighting
   - shadowGray100: Neutral gray for ambient/overcast lighting

3. Clarified that semantic tokens provide purpose-based naming while referencing systematic primitives

### Key Decisions

**Decision 1**: Maintain art theory rationale while updating token names
- **Rationale**: The art theory principles (warm light creates cool shadows) remain valid regardless of naming convention
- **Implementation**: Documented the art theory rationale with updated token names

**Decision 2**: Add explicit semantic mapping criterion
- **Rationale**: Makes the relationship between primitive color family and semantic tokens explicit in requirements
- **Implementation**: Added criterion 5 with clear mapping documentation

**Decision 3**: Document systematic color family benefits
- **Rationale**: Helps readers understand why the refactoring was done and the architectural benefits
- **Implementation**: Added dedicated "Shadow Color Family Architecture" section

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors in requirements.md
✅ Markdown formatting correct
✅ All sections properly structured

### Functional Validation
✅ Requirement 1.4 updated with shadow color family structure
✅ Acceptance criteria reference shadowBlack100, shadowBlue100, shadowOrange100, shadowGray100
✅ Semantic mapping documented (shadowBlack100 → color.shadow.default, etc.)
✅ Art theory rationale maintained with updated token names
✅ Systematic color family structure benefits documented

### Integration Validation
✅ Requirements align with implemented code in ColorTokens.ts
✅ Requirements align with semantic tokens in semantic/ColorTokens.ts
✅ Requirements align with design document shadow color family architecture
✅ Acceptance criteria match actual implementation

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 1.4: Shadow color family acceptance criteria updated
✅ All task objectives completed:
  - Changed from shadowDefault/shadowWarm/shadowCool/shadowAmbient to shadowBlack100/shadowBlue100/shadowOrange100/shadowGray100
  - Updated semantic mapping criteria
  - Maintained art theory rationale
  - Documented systematic color family structure benefits

## Requirements Compliance

**Requirement 1.4**: Shadow color primitives and semantics

The requirements document now accurately reflects the shadow color family architecture:
- Primitive tokens use systematic color family structure (shadowBlack100, shadowBlue100, shadowOrange100, shadowGray100)
- Semantic tokens provide purpose-based naming (color.shadow.default, color.shadow.warm, color.shadow.cool, color.shadow.ambient)
- Art theory rationale documented (warm light creates cool shadows, cool light creates warm shadows)
- Systematic color family benefits explained (architectural consistency, future flexibility, clear relationships)

The updated requirements provide clear guidance for the shadow color system and align with the implemented code.

*This completion document records the requirements update that aligns the specification with the shadow color family architecture implemented in tasks 2.6 and 2.7.*
