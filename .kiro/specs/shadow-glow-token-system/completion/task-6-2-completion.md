# Task 6.2 Completion: Create Glow Token Documentation

**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Task**: 6.2 Create glow token documentation  
**Type**: Implementation  
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `docs/tokens/glow-tokens.md` - Comprehensive glow token documentation with primitive reference, usage guidelines, and future scope

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Created comprehensive documentation for glow primitive tokens following the same format and style as the shadow token documentation. The documentation covers all glow primitives (blur, opacity, color) with detailed usage guidelines, mathematical foundations, and clear indication of future scope items.

### Documentation Structure

The glow token documentation includes:

1. **Overview**: Introduction to glow token system and current scope
2. **Glow Primitive Tokens**: Detailed reference for blur, opacity, and color primitives
3. **Future Scope Sections**: Clear documentation of semantic glows, multi-layer architecture, and cross-platform implementation as future work
4. **Design Guidelines**: When to use glows, intensity guidelines, color selection, and accessibility considerations
5. **Mathematical Foundation**: Base-8 system, baseline grid alignment, and comparison to shadow tokens
6. **Current Implementation Status**: Clear breakdown of what's available now vs future scope

### Key Decisions

**Decision 1**: Comprehensive future scope documentation

**Rationale**: While semantic glows and cross-platform implementation are future scope, documenting the conceptual approach provides:
- Clear vision for future development
- Examples for proof of concept work
- Understanding of why certain features are deferred
- Guidance for experimentation with primitives

**Decision 2**: Detailed comparison to shadow tokens

**Rationale**: Comparing glow and shadow tokens helps readers understand:
- Why glows have different ranges (8-40px vs 4-24px)
- Why glows have higher opacity (0.2-0.8 vs 0.2-0.4)
- Why glows are radial (0px offset) vs directional shadows
- The distinct purposes of each system (emphasis vs depth)

**Decision 3**: Accessibility emphasis

**Rationale**: Glows have unique accessibility considerations:
- Photosensitivity concerns with animated glows
- Contrast issues with high-opacity glows
- Motion sensitivity with glow transitions
- Need for reduced motion alternatives

### Documentation Highlights

**Glow Blur Tokens**:
- Extended range (8px - 40px) for radial emphasis effects
- Linear progression with base-8 system
- Clear comparison to shadow blur range

**Glow Opacity Tokens**:
- Decreasing progression (0.8 - 0.2) for multi-layer architecture
- Higher opacity range than shadows for visual impact
- Designed for layering with natural radial fade

**Glow Color Tokens**:
- Reference existing vibrant primitives (purple500, cyan500, yellow500)
- Semantic naming for emphasis effects (neonPurple, neonCyan, neonYellow)
- Clear rationale for color selection

**Future Scope Clarity**:
- Semantic glow tokens (conceptual examples provided)
- Multi-layer glow architecture (design principles documented)
- Cross-platform implementation (challenges and approaches outlined)
- Clear explanation of why these are deferred (proof of concept needed)
