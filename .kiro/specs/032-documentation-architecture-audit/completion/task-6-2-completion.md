# Task 6.2 Completion: Create Draft Findings and Get Human Confirmation

**Date**: 2025-12-30
**Task**: 6.2 Create draft findings and get Human confirmation
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## What Was Done

1. **Reviewed Draft Findings**: Analyzed the draft findings document created in Task 6.1 for `docs/testing/test-infrastructure-guide.md`

2. **Presented to Human for Review**: Provided summary of findings including:
   - Unique value identified (Jest mock patterns, token test data, pitfall solutions)
   - Relationship to steering docs (complementary, not redundant)
   - MCP candidacy assessment (not recommended)

3. **Engaged in Discussion**: Responded to Human's questions about:
   - Alignment with current methods/infrastructure/practices
   - Potential conflicts with existing documentation
   - Usefulness for AI agents
   - Overlap assessment

4. **Received Human Confirmation**: Human confirmed disposition:
   - Keep with minor optional updates
   - No MCP integration needed
   - Document serves as developer reference, not AI steering

5. **Created Confirmed Actions Document**: Documented final disposition at `.kiro/specs/032-documentation-architecture-audit/findings/confirmed-testing-actions.md`

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/specs/032-documentation-architecture-audit/findings/confirmed-testing-actions.md` - Human-confirmed disposition

---

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Keep document | Provides unique practical value for developers |
| No MCP integration | Steering docs already serve AI agents; this is developer-focused |
| Optional updates only | Low priority; document is functional as-is |

---

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

- [x] Draft findings reviewed with Human
- [x] Human questions addressed honestly
- [x] Confirmed actions document created
- [x] Disposition documented with rationale
