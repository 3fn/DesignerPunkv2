# Implementation Plan: Release Management System

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Spec**: F4 - Release Management System  
**Status**: Implementation Planning  
**Dependencies**: F1 - Mathematical Token System (Complete), F2 - Cross-Platform Build System (Complete)

---

## Implementation Plan

This implementation plan converts the Release Management System design into a series of systematic coding tasks that build a complete, automated versioning and release pipeline. The approach prioritizes establishing core infrastructure first, then building individual components, and finally integrating everything into a cohesive system that seamlessly integrates with the existing DesignerPunk workflow.

The implementation follows the contamination prevention principle by building complete automation that eliminates manual decision points while maintaining human oversight through validation gates and configuration-driven customization.

  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

  **Context from Task 2.5 Completion:**
  The extraction logic improvements in Task 2.5 have caused expected test failures in integration tests. These failures are NOT bugs but consequences of more accurate extraction:
  
  **Root Cause of Test Failures:**
  - Prioritized extraction strategy eliminates dual extraction → tests expecting duplicates now fail
  - Semantic deduplication reduces false positives → tests expecting inflated counts now fail
  - Documentation filtering prevents doc fixes from triggering releases → tests expecting patches now fail
  - Improved section parsing changes extraction results → tests expecting specific content now fail
  
  **Specific Test Issues to Address:**
  - DetectionSystemIntegration tests expect old extraction behavior (6 failed tests)
  - Bug fix extraction: Tests expect 3 bug fixes but get 0 (more selective extraction)
  - Breaking change detection: Tests expect specific descriptions not extracted with new logic
  - Version bump calculation: Tests expect "minor" but get "major" due to changed extraction results
  - Confidence scoring: Improved accuracy affects confidence calculations
  
  **Validation Strategy:**
  - Verify new extraction is more accurate (not just different)
  - Update test data to reflect real-world scenarios (not artificial edge cases)
  - Validate confidence scoring improvements are working correctly
  - DO NOT revert extraction improvements - update tests to match improved behavior
  
  **Regression Prevention:**
  Create specific regression tests for the issues that were fixed:
  - Dual extraction duplication
  - Header contamination and content bleeding
  - Malformed descriptions from context bleeding
  - Poor semantic deduplication accuracy
