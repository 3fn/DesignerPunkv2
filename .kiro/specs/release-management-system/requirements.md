# Requirements Document: Release Management System

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Spec**: F4 - Release Management System  
**Status**: Requirements Phase  
**Dependencies**: F1 - Mathematical Token System (Complete), F2 - Cross-Platform Build System (Complete)

---

## Introduction

The Release Management System provides automated, intelligent versioning and release management for the DesignerPunk design system. This system eliminates manual decision points in the release process while maintaining semantic versioning standards and integrating seamlessly with the existing spec-driven development workflow.

This system follows the contamination prevention principle by automating release decisions based on objective criteria (spec completion, task completion, breaking changes) rather than subjective human judgment. It supports the AI collaboration framework by providing clear, semantic version progression that AI agents can understand and work with reliably.

**Key Architectural Principles**:
- Complete automation of semantic versioning decisions
- Integration with existing spec-driven development workflow  
- Contamination prevention through objective release criteria
- Multi-package coordination across the DesignerPunk ecosystem
- AI collaboration support through clear semantic progression

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automated Semantic Versioning

**User Story**: As a developer working on the DesignerPunk system, I want version numbers to be automatically managed according to semantic versioning standards, so that I never have to manually decide or remember to update version numbers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a spec is completed THEN the system SHALL automatically bump the minor version (0.1.0 → 0.2.0)
2. WHEN a task is completed THEN the system SHALL optionally bump the patch version (0.1.0 → 0.1.1)
3. WHEN breaking changes are detected in completion documentation THEN the system SHALL bump the major version (0.1.0 → 1.0.0)
4. WHEN version bumping occurs THEN the system SHALL update all relevant package.json files consistently
5. WHEN pre-release versions are used THEN the system SHALL follow semantic versioning pre-release conventions (alpha, beta, rc)

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Release Detection

**User Story**: As a developer completing specs and tasks, I want the system to automatically detect when a release should occur based on the significance of my work, so that releases happen at appropriate milestones without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a spec completion document is created THEN the system SHALL detect this as a minor release trigger
2. WHEN task completion occurs THEN the system SHALL analyze the task significance to determine if a patch release is warranted
3. WHEN completion documents contain breaking change markers THEN the system SHALL detect this as a major release trigger
4. WHEN multiple changes accumulate THEN the system SHALL determine the highest significance level for version bumping
5. WHEN manual override is requested THEN the system SHALL allow explicit version bump specification

### Requirement 3: Automated Release Note Generation

**User Story**: As a user of the DesignerPunk system, I want comprehensive release notes that clearly explain what changed in each version, so that I can understand the impact and benefits of updating.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a release is created THEN the system SHALL generate release notes from spec completion documents
2. WHEN task completion summaries exist THEN the system SHALL include relevant task achievements in release notes
3. WHEN breaking changes are present THEN the system SHALL clearly highlight these in release notes with migration guidance
4. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL extract feature descriptions from completion documentation
5. WHEN bug fixes are included THEN the system SHALL list resolved issues with clear descriptions

### Requirement 4: Multi-Package Coordination

**User Story**: As a maintainer of the DesignerPunk ecosystem, I want version coordination across multiple packages (@designerpunk/tokens, @designerpunk/build-system, @designerpunk/components), so that the system maintains consistency while allowing appropriate independence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN core system changes occur THEN the system SHALL synchronize versions across core packages (@designerpunk/tokens, @designerpunk/build-system)
2. WHEN component-specific changes occur THEN the system SHALL allow independent versioning for @designerpunk/components
3. WHEN dependency relationships exist THEN the system SHALL update package dependencies to maintain compatibility
4. WHEN version conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution strategies
5. WHEN package publishing occurs THEN the system SHALL coordinate publishing order to prevent dependency issues

### Requirement 5: GitHub Integration and Publishing

**User Story**: As a developer completing work on DesignerPunk, I want releases to be automatically published to GitHub with proper tagging and documentation, so that the release process is complete and discoverable without manual steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a release is ready THEN the system SHALL create appropriate Git tags with semantic version numbers
2. WHEN release notes are generated THEN the system SHALL publish GitHub releases with complete documentation
3. WHEN packages are ready THEN the system SHALL publish to npm registry with correct version numbers
4. WHEN release artifacts exist THEN the system SHALL attach relevant build outputs to GitHub releases
5. WHEN publishing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 6: Workflow Integration

**User Story**: As a developer using the existing DesignerPunk workflow, I want release management to integrate seamlessly with the current hook system and spec-driven development process, so that releases happen naturally as part of completing work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the existing commit-task hook runs THEN the system SHALL integrate release detection without disrupting current workflow
2. WHEN file organization occurs THEN the system SHALL coordinate with the organization system to ensure release artifacts are properly placed
3. WHEN spec completion is detected THEN the system SHALL trigger appropriate release processes automatically
4. WHEN cross-reference updates happen THEN the system SHALL ensure release documentation maintains link integrity
5. WHEN AI agent hooks execute THEN the system SHALL provide clear interfaces for AI-driven release management

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Customization

**User Story**: As a maintainer of the DesignerPunk system, I want to configure release behavior and customize the system for different scenarios, so that the release management adapts to evolving needs without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive configuration file for all release behaviors
2. WHEN version bump rules need adjustment THEN the system SHALL allow customization of detection criteria and bump logic
3. WHEN release note templates need modification THEN the system SHALL support customizable templates and formatting
4. WHEN package coordination rules change THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of multi-package versioning strategies
5. WHEN GitHub integration needs customization THEN the system SHALL support configurable publishing workflows and authentication

### Requirement 8: Release Validation and Safety

**User Story**: As a developer relying on automated releases, I want comprehensive validation and safety measures to prevent incorrect or harmful releases, so that the automation enhances rather than compromises release quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a release is about to occur THEN the system SHALL validate that all completion documentation exists and is properly formatted
2. WHEN version bumping is calculated THEN the system SHALL verify the bump logic against semantic versioning rules
3. WHEN breaking changes are detected THEN the system SHALL require explicit confirmation or documentation of migration paths
4. WHEN release publishing fails THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities to restore previous state
5. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages with resolution guidance
