# Task 6.2 Completion: Document Blend vs Explicit Colors Guidance

**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Task**: 6.2 Document blend vs explicit colors guidance
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/specs/blend-tokens/blend-vs-explicit-colors.md` - Comprehensive decision framework for choosing between blend tokens and explicit color tokens

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Created a comprehensive decision framework document that helps developers choose between blend tokens and explicit color variants. The guide is structured to provide clear decision criteria, practical examples, and a step-by-step framework for making the right choice based on specific project needs.

The document emphasizes that blend tokens and explicit colors **coexist** rather than compete - blend tokens are modifiers, explicit colors are definitions. Both have valid use cases depending on requirements.

### Key Sections

**When to Use Blend Tokens**:
- Dynamic theming scenarios
- Consistent interaction patterns across colors
- Reducing token count
- Multi-platform consistency needs

**When to Use Explicit Colors**:
- Precise brand color requirements
- Frequently-used combinations (performance)
- Performance-critical scenarios
- Design requiring non-mathematical relationships

**Coexistence Strategy**:
- Blend as modifier, not replacement
- Hybrid approach (blend for most, explicit for exceptions)
- Migration path from explicit to blend

**Decision Framework**:
- 5-step decision process
- Clear questions at each step
- Default recommendation (prefer blend, use explicit when needed)

**Examples by Use Case**:
- Multi-brand product (use blend)
- Strict brand guidelines (use explicit)
- Design system library (use blend)
- Performance-critical animation (use explicit)

### Design Decisions

**Decision 1**: Coexistence over replacement
- **Rationale**: Blend tokens don't replace explicit colors - they provide an alternative approach for different use cases
- **Benefit**: Developers can choose the right tool for each situation

**Decision 2**: Decision framework with clear steps
- **Rationale**: Provides systematic approach to choosing between blend and explicit colors
- **Benefit**: Reduces ambiguity and helps developers make informed decisions

**Decision 3**: Practical examples for common scenarios
- **Rationale**: Real-world use cases help developers understand when each approach is appropriate
- **Benefit**: Faster decision-making based on pattern matching

**Decision 4**: Default recommendation (prefer blend)
- **Rationale**: Blend provides more flexibility for most use cases
- **Benefit**: Guides developers toward flexible solutions while allowing explicit colors when needed

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ Markdown formatting correct
✅ All code examples use valid syntax

### Functional Validation
✅ Document explains when to use blend (dynamic theming, consistent patterns)
✅ Document explains when to use explicit colors (precise control, brand guidelines)
✅ Coexistence strategy documented (blend as modifier)
✅ Decision framework provided with clear steps
✅ Examples cover common use cases

### Integration Validation
✅ Cross-references blend-usage-guide.md for usage patterns
✅ Cross-references requirements.md for coexistence strategy
✅ Integrates with overall blend token documentation
✅ Consistent terminology with other blend documentation

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 11: Relationship to explicit color tokens explained
  - Coexistence strategy documented
