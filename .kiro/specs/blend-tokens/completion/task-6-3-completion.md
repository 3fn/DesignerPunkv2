# Task 6.3 Completion: Create AI Agent Guidance for Blend Selection

**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Task**: 6.3 Create AI agent guidance for blend selection
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete
**Organization**: spec-completion
**Scope**: blend-tokens

---

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/specs/blend-tokens/ai-agent-blend-selection-guide.md` - Comprehensive AI agent guidance for blend token selection and usage

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Created a comprehensive guide specifically designed for AI agents to make appropriate decisions when generating code with blend tokens. The guide focuses on providing clear decision criteria, selection patterns, and boundary definitions rather than just examples.

The document is structured around decision-making processes that AI agents can follow systematically:

1. **Blend Direction Selection Criteria** - Decision tree and logic for choosing darker, lighter, saturate, or desaturate
2. **Blend Value Selection Criteria** - Guidelines for choosing blend100-blend500 based on feedback strength
3. **Semantic Token Selection Guidance** - When to prefer semantic tokens over primitives
4. **Composition Pattern Guidance** - When and how to compose blend with opacity
5. **Component Token Boundary** - Clear definition of what belongs in token system vs component library

### Key Decisions

**Decision 1**: Decision Tree Format
- **Rationale**: AI agents work well with structured decision trees that provide clear branching logic
- **Implementation**: Used ASCII decision trees with clear YES/NO branches and specific outcomes
- **Alternative**: Could have used prose descriptions, but decision trees are more actionable for AI

**Decision 2**: Checklist-Based Verification
- **Rationale**: AI agents benefit from explicit checklists to verify their decisions before generating code
- **Implementation**: Included comprehensive checklist covering all aspects of blend token usage
- **Alternative**: Could have relied on examples alone, but checklists provide systematic verification

**Decision 3**: Common Mistakes Section
- **Rationale**: AI agents learn well from anti-patterns and explicit "wrong vs correct" examples
- **Implementation**: Documented 5 common mistakes with side-by-side wrong/correct code examples
- **Alternative**: Could have focused only on correct patterns, but showing mistakes helps prevent them

**Decision 4**: Quick Reference Tables
- **Rationale**: AI agents need fast lookup for common patterns without reading entire guide
- **Implementation**: Created multiple quick reference tables for blend direction, values, and semantic tokens
- **Alternative**: Could have embedded references throughout, but centralized tables are more efficient

### Integration Points

The AI agent guidance integrates with:
- **Blend Usage Guide**: References comprehensive examples for detailed patterns
- **Blend vs Explicit Colors Guide**: References decision framework for when to use blend
- **Design Document**: References architectural decisions and rationale
- **Requirements Document**: References requirements that inform selection criteria

### Content Structure

**Section 1: Blend Direction Selection Criteria**
- Decision tree for choosing blend direction
- Detailed criteria for each direction (darker, lighter, saturate, desaturate)
- Background color criteria and interaction type criteria
- Example decision logic for AI agents to follow

**Section 2: Blend Value Selection Criteria**
- Feedback strength guidelines (subtle, standard, strong, very strong, maximum)
- When to select each blend value (blend100-blend500)
- Decision matrix mapping element types to blend values
- Element type and interaction state combinations

**Section 3: Semantic Token Selection Guidance**
- When to use semantic tokens vs primitive tokens
- Available semantic tokens with descriptions
- Semantic token selection decision tree
- Example usage patterns (good, acceptable, avoid)

**Section 4: Composition Pattern Guidance**
- Blend-only composition pattern and when to use
- Blend + opacity composition pattern and when to use
- Order of operations (blend → opacity)
- Composition decision tree

**Section 5: Component Token Boundary**
- Clear definition of token system responsibility
- Clear definition of component library responsibility
- Decision criteria for boundary questions
- Boundary examples (token system vs component library)

**Section 6: AI Agent Decision Checklist**
- 6-step verification checklist covering all aspects
- Specific items to verify for each step
- Ensures systematic verification before code generation

**Section 7: Common AI Agent Mistakes**
- 5 common mistakes with wrong/correct examples
- Explanations of why each mistake is problematic
- Clear guidance on correct approach

**Section 8: Quick Reference**
- Blend direction quick guide table
- Blend value quick guide table
- Semantic token quick reference list
- Fast lookup for common patterns

### Documentation Approach

**AI-Agent-Specific Language**:
- Used imperative language ("Select", "Choose", "Verify")
- Provided explicit decision logic ("If X, then Y")
- Included systematic checklists for verification
- Structured content for algorithmic decision-making

**Decision-Focused Content**:
- Emphasized decision criteria over examples
- Provided decision trees for complex choices
- Included verification steps for each decision
- Documented reasoning behind each guideline

**Boundary Clarity**:
- Explicitly defined what belongs in token system vs component library
- Provided decision criteria questions for boundary cases
- Included examples of correct boundary placement
- Addressed common boundary confusion

## Notes

This guide is specifically designed for AI agents and uses language, structure, and content optimized for algorithmic decision-making. The focus is on providing clear decision criteria, systematic verification processes, and explicit boundary definitions rather than just examples.

The guide complements the Blend Usage Guide (which provides comprehensive examples) by focusing on the decision-making process that AI agents need to follow when selecting and using blend tokens.
