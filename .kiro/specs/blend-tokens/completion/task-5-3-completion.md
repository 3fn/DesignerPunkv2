# Task 5.3 Completion: Create Composition Tests

**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Task**: 5.3 Create composition tests
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- Enhanced `src/composition/__tests__/BlendCompositionParser.test.ts` - Added comprehensive composition validation tests

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Added comprehensive tests to the existing BlendCompositionParser test file to cover all composition validation scenarios. The tests verify:

1. **"color with blend direction" parsing** - Already covered by existing tests
2. **"color with blend direction at opacity" parsing** - Already covered in OpacityCompositionParser tests
3. **Composition validation** - Added new test suite
4. **Order of operations (blend → opacity)** - Verified in OpacityCompositionParser tests
5. **All blend directions work in composition** - Added new test suite

### Key Test Additions

**All Blend Directions Test Suite**:
- Tests each direction (darker, lighter, saturate, desaturate) individually
- Tests all directions work with different colors
- Tests all directions work with different blend values
- Verifies comprehensive direction support across the composition system

**Composition Validation Test Suite**:
- Validates complete composition structure (color, blend, direction, original)
- Validates color token exists before blend token (validation order)
- Validates blend token exists after color token
- Validates direction is valid after blend token
- Validates all parts of composition together
- Preserves original composition string
- Validates composition with semantic tokens

### Integration with Existing Tests

The blend + opacity composition tests already exist in `OpacityCompositionParser.test.ts` and cover:
- Parsing "color with blend direction at opacity" syntax
- All four blend directions (darker, lighter, saturate, desaturate)
- Order enforcement (blend first, then opacity)
- Invalid syntax and token reference validation
- Semantic token support

This task focused on adding comprehensive validation tests to the BlendCompositionParser test suite to ensure complete coverage of composition validation scenarios.

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ All imports resolve correctly
✅ Type annotations correct

### Functional Validation
✅ All 36 tests in BlendCompositionParser.test.ts pass
✅ All 43 tests in OpacityCompositionParser.test.ts pass
✅ "color with blend direction" parsing works for all directions
✅ "color with blend direction at opacity" parsing works (verified in OpacityCompositionParser)
✅ Composition validation catches all error cases
✅ Order of operations (blend → opacity) enforced by syntax
✅ All blend directions work in composition

### Integration Validation
✅ Tests integrate with existing BlendCompositionParser implementation
✅ Tests integrate with PrimitiveTokenRegistry for token validation
✅ Tests integrate with SemanticTokenRegistry for semantic token support
✅ Tests coordinate with OpacityCompositionParser tests for blend + opacity composition

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 5: Universal color application - Tests verify blend works with any color token
✅ Requirement 10: Blend and opacity composition - Tests verify composition syntax and order of operations

## Test Coverage Summary

**BlendCompositionParser Tests (36 tests)**:
- Basic parsing (12 tests)
- parseOrThrow method (3 tests)
- isBlendComposition method (5 tests)
- Semantic token support (3 tests)
- All blend directions in composition (5 tests)
- Composition validation (8 tests)

**OpacityCompositionParser Tests (43 tests)**:
- Simple opacity composition (20 tests)
- Blend + opacity composition (18 tests)
- Order enforcement (2 tests)
- Helper methods (3 tests)

**Total Coverage**: 79 tests covering all composition scenarios

## Key Insights

1. **Comprehensive Direction Coverage**: Tests verify all four blend directions (darker, lighter, saturate, desaturate) work correctly in composition syntax

2. **Validation Order**: Tests confirm validation happens in the correct order (color → blend → direction), providing clear error messages at each step

3. **Semantic Token Support**: Tests verify composition works with both primitive and semantic tokens for colors and blends

4. **Order Enforcement**: The syntax "color with blend direction at opacity" naturally enforces the correct order of operations (blend first, then opacity)

5. **Integration Testing**: Tests verify composition parsers integrate correctly with token registries and validate token existence

## Notes

- The blend + opacity composition tests are in OpacityCompositionParser.test.ts because that parser handles the "at opacity" syntax
- BlendCompositionParser focuses on "color with blend direction" syntax
- Both parsers coordinate to provide complete composition support
- All tests pass successfully, confirming composition validation works as designed
