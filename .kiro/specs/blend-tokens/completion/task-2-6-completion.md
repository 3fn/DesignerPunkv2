# Task 2.6 Completion: Create BlendCalculator Orchestrator

**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Task**: 2.6 Create BlendCalculator orchestrator
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `src/blend/BlendCalculator.ts` - BlendCalculator orchestrator class and convenience function
- `src/blend/__tests__/BlendCalculator.test.ts` - Integration tests for all blend directions
- `src/blend/index.ts` - Updated to export BlendCalculator and calculateBlend

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Implemented the BlendCalculator orchestrator that routes blend calculations to the appropriate function based on the specified direction. The implementation follows a clean orchestration pattern where the calculator:

1. Accepts color as hex string, blend token, and direction
2. Converts hex to RGB using existing color space utilities
3. Routes to the appropriate blend function (darker, lighter, saturate, desaturate)
4. Converts the result back to hex string

The orchestrator provides both a class-based API (`BlendCalculator`) and a convenience function (`calculateBlend`) for flexibility in usage patterns.

### Key Decisions

**Decision 1**: Class-based orchestrator with convenience function
- **Rationale**: Provides flexibility for both stateful and stateless usage patterns. The class can be instantiated for repeated use, while the convenience function offers a simpler API for one-off calculations.
- **Alternative**: Could have used only a function-based approach, but the class provides better extensibility for future enhancements.

**Decision 2**: Switch statement for direction routing
- **Rationale**: Clear, explicit routing logic that's easy to understand and maintain. Each direction is handled in a separate case with clear error handling for unsupported directions.
- **Alternative**: Could have used a strategy pattern with a map of direction to function, but the switch statement is more straightforward for this use case.

**Decision 3**: Comprehensive integration tests
- **Rationale**: Tests cover all blend directions, all blend tokens, error handling, and cross-direction integration to ensure the orchestrator works correctly with all combinations.
- **Alternative**: Could have written minimal tests, but comprehensive coverage ensures reliability for this critical orchestration component.

### Integration Points

The BlendCalculator integrates with:
- `ColorSpaceUtils` for hex/RGB conversions and blend calculations
- `BlendTokens` for blend token definitions and BlendDirection enum
- `PrimitiveToken` type for token structure

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ All imports resolve correctly
✅ Type annotations correct

### Functional Validation
✅ calculateBlend() routes to correct blend function for each direction
✅ Darker direction produces darker colors (verified with multiple colors)
✅ Lighter direction produces lighter colors (verified with multiple colors)
✅ Saturate direction increases color saturation
✅ Desaturate direction decreases color saturation
✅ All blend tokens (blend100-blend500) work correctly
✅ Hex format handling works with and without # prefix, and with 3-digit hex
✅ Error handling works for invalid hex colors and unsupported directions

### Integration Validation
✅ Integrates with hexToRgb for color parsing
✅ Integrates with rgbToHex for color formatting
✅ Integrates with all four blend calculation functions
✅ Integrates with BlendDirection enum
✅ Integrates with PrimitiveToken type
✅ Convenience function produces same results as class method

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 4: Implements calculateBlend() method that routes to correct blend function
✅ Requirement 5: Accepts baseColor, blendToken, and direction parameters
✅ Requirement 6: Returns calculated color as hex string
✅ Integration tests created for all blend directions

## Test Results

All 29 tests passed:
- 3 tests for darker blend direction
- 3 tests for lighter blend direction
- 3 tests for saturate blend direction
- 3 tests for desaturate blend direction
- 2 tests for error handling
- 5 tests for integration with all blend tokens
- 3 tests for hex format handling
- 5 tests for convenience function
- 2 tests for cross-direction integration

Test coverage includes:
- All four blend directions (darker, lighter, saturate, desaturate)
- All five blend tokens (blend100-blend500)
- Multiple base colors (purple, blue, green, red)
- Hex format variations (with/without #, 3-digit and 6-digit)
- Error cases (invalid hex, unsupported direction)
- Edge cases (maximum saturation, minimum saturation)
- Cross-direction integration (multiple colors and directions)
