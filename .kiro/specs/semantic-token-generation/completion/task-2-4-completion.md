# Task 2.4 Completion: Add Header Comment with Usage Guidance

**Date**: January 25, 2025
**Task**: 2.4 Add header comment with usage guidance
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Modified

- `src/providers/WebFormatGenerator.ts` - Extended `generateHeader()` method to include usage guidance

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Extended the existing `generateHeader()` method in WebFormatGenerator to include usage guidance in the header comment. The guidance is added to both CSS and JavaScript output formats, providing developers with clear direction on when to use semantic vs primitive tokens.

### Key Implementation

Added three lines of usage guidance to the header comment:
1. "Use semantic tokens (colorPrimary, borderDefault) for all UI development"
2. "Use primitive tokens (purple300, space100) only when no semantic exists"
3. "Comments show semantic → primitive relationships"

The guidance is formatted consistently with the existing header structure and appears in both CSS and JavaScript output formats.

### Integration Points

The updated header is generated by the `generateHeader()` method which is called during token file generation. The guidance appears at the top of every generated web token file, providing immediate visibility to developers.

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ All imports resolve correctly
✅ Type annotations correct

### Functional Validation
✅ Header includes all three usage guidance lines
✅ Guidance appears in both CSS and JavaScript formats
✅ Header structure remains valid with added guidance
✅ Existing header metadata (timestamp, version, platform) preserved

### Integration Validation
✅ Integrates with existing generateHeader() method
✅ Works with both CSS and JavaScript output formats
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
✅ All existing tests pass (58 tests in FormatProviders.test.ts)
✅ All semantic token tests pass (11 tests in WebFormatGenerator-semantic.test.ts)

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 4.1: Header comment explains file structure and usage guidance
✅ Requirement 4.5: Usage guidance directs developers to use semantic tokens first

## Requirements Compliance

**Requirement 4.1**: WHEN generating token files THEN THE system SHALL include a header comment explaining the file structure and usage guidance
- ✅ Header comment now includes explicit usage guidance section
- ✅ Guidance explains when to use semantic vs primitive tokens
- ✅ Guidance appears in all generated web token files

**Requirement 4.5**: WHEN generating token files THEN THE system SHALL include usage guidance directing developers to use semantic tokens first
- ✅ First guidance line explicitly directs developers to use semantic tokens for UI development
- ✅ Second guidance line clarifies primitive tokens are fallback when no semantic exists
- ✅ Third guidance line explains that comments show relationships

## Implementation Notes

The implementation is minimal and focused - it only extends the header comment without changing any other functionality. The guidance is clear, concise, and actionable, providing developers with immediate understanding of the token hierarchy and usage patterns.

The guidance format follows the existing header comment style, using bullet points for readability and maintaining consistency with the rest of the header structure.
