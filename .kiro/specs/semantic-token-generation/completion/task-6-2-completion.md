# Task 6.2 Completion: Write Unit Tests for Semantic Token Export

**Date**: January 15, 2025
**Task**: 6.2 Write unit tests for semantic token export
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Modified

- `src/tokens/semantic/__tests__/SemanticTokenIntegration.test.ts` - Enhanced existing tests with additional coverage for task requirements

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Enhanced the existing `SemanticTokenIntegration.test.ts` file with additional test cases to meet the specific requirements of task 6.2. Rather than creating a new test file, I added comprehensive tests to the existing test suite to ensure:

1. `getAllSemanticTokens()` returns all semantic tokens
2. All token categories are included (color, spacing, typography, border)
3. Token counts are accurate and match statistics
4. Each token has valid structure with all required fields

### Key Decisions

**Decision 1**: Enhance existing tests rather than create new file
- **Rationale**: The existing `SemanticTokenIntegration.test.ts` already had comprehensive coverage of semantic token functionality. Adding to this file maintains test organization and avoids duplication.
- **Alternative**: Could have created a separate `SemanticTokenExport.test.ts` file, but this would have resulted in overlapping test coverage.

**Decision 2**: Add explicit border token verification
- **Rationale**: The original tests verified color, typography, and spacing tokens but didn't explicitly verify border tokens. Added specific test to ensure border tokens are included in `getAllSemanticTokens()`.
- **Implementation**: Verified that border tokens exist and have the correct naming pattern (`border.borderDefault`, etc.)

**Decision 3**: Add token count validation
- **Rationale**: Task requirements specified testing "returns correct count of semantic tokens". Added test that validates the count returned by `getAllSemanticTokens()` matches the statistics from `getSemanticTokenStats()`.
- **Implementation**: Compared total count and category-specific counts between the two functions to ensure consistency.

**Decision 4**: Add comprehensive structure validation
- **Rationale**: Task requirements specified testing "each token has valid structure". Added test that iterates through all tokens and validates each one has required fields (name, primitiveReferences, category, context, description).
- **Implementation**: Used both manual field checks and the `validateSemanticTokenStructure()` utility function to ensure comprehensive validation.

### Tests Added

1. **should include color, spacing, typography, and border tokens**
   - Verifies all four token categories are present in `getAllSemanticTokens()`
   - Checks for specific example tokens from each category
   - Ensures border tokens are included with correct naming

2. **should return correct count of semantic tokens**
   - Validates total token count matches statistics
   - Verifies category-specific counts match between `getAllSemanticTokens()` and `getSemanticTokenStats()`
   - Ensures consistency across different access methods

3. **should ensure each token has valid structure**
   - Iterates through all tokens returned by `getAllSemanticTokens()`
   - Validates each token has all required fields
   - Checks field types and non-empty values
   - Uses `validateSemanticTokenStructure()` for comprehensive validation

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ All imports resolve correctly
✅ Type annotations correct

### Functional Validation
✅ All 32 tests pass successfully
✅ `getAllSemanticTokens()` returns all semantic tokens across categories
✅ Color tokens included and verified (color.primary exists)
✅ Spacing tokens included and verified (space.grouped.normal, space.inset.comfortable exist)
✅ Typography tokens included and verified (typography.bodyMd exists)
✅ Border tokens included and verified (border.borderDefault exists)
✅ Token counts match statistics (total and by category)
✅ Each token has valid structure with all required fields

### Integration Validation
✅ Tests integrate with existing semantic token test suite
✅ Tests use actual semantic token implementations (no mocks)
✅ Tests validate real token data from all categories
✅ Tests work with `getSemanticTokenStats()` utility function

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 1.1: Test `getAllSemanticTokens()` returns all semantic tokens
✅ Requirement 1.2: Test includes color semantic tokens
✅ Requirement 1.3: Test includes spacing semantic tokens (all categories)
✅ Requirement 1.4: Test includes typography semantic tokens
✅ Requirement 1.5: Test includes border semantic tokens
✅ Additional: Test returns correct count of semantic tokens
✅ Additional: Test each token has valid structure

## Implementation Notes

### Border Token Naming
Border tokens are exported as `borderDefault`, `borderEmphasis`, `borderHeavy` from `BorderWidthTokens.ts`, but when added to `getAllSemanticTokens()`, they are prefixed with `border.` to create the full token name (e.g., `border.borderDefault`). This follows the same pattern as other semantic tokens (e.g., `color.primary`, `typography.bodyMd`).

### Test Organization
The tests are organized within the existing `getAllSemanticTokens` describe block, maintaining consistency with the existing test structure. Each new test focuses on a specific aspect of the task requirements:
- Token category inclusion
- Token count accuracy
- Token structure validation

### Validation Approach
The tests use a combination of:
- Direct field checks (manual validation)
- Utility function validation (`validateSemanticTokenStructure()`)
- Statistical validation (`getSemanticTokenStats()`)

This multi-layered approach ensures comprehensive coverage and catches issues at different levels of abstraction.
