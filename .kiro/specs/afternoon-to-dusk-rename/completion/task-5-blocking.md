# Task 5 Blocking Documentation: Regenerate Platform Code

**Date**: October 25, 2025
**Task**: 5. Regenerate Platform Code
**Type**: Parent
**Status**: Blocked - Semantic Token Generation Not Implemented

---

## Success Criteria Status

**Original Success Criteria:**
- ❌ Platform-specific code generated with "dusk" naming - **BLOCKED**
- ❌ Generated values identical to pre-rename output - **BLOCKED**
- ❌ All platforms (web, iOS, Android) updated - **BLOCKED**

**Actual Status:**
- ✅ Semantic token renamed at source level (afternoon → dusk)
- ✅ Token definition mathematically correct
- ❌ Platform generation blocked by architectural gap

---

## Blocking Issue Summary

All subtasks (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4) are blocked because **semantic tokens are not integrated into the platform generation system**.

### Current State

**What Works:**
- ✅ Primitive token generation (`generateTokenFiles.ts`)
- ✅ Generates web, iOS, Android files with 156 primitive tokens each
- ✅ Mathematical consistency validated across platforms

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Semantic token generation not implemented
- ❌ `WebShadowGenerator`, `iOSShadowGenerator`, `AndroidShadowGenerator` exist but not wired up
- ❌ No integration between semantic token system and platform generation

**Impact:**
- Generated files contain only primitive tokens (shadowOffsetX, shadowBlur, etc.)
- Semantic tokens (shadow.dusk, shadow.container, etc.) not present in output
- Developers cannot use semantic shadow tokens in platform code

---

## Architectural Analysis

### Two Parallel Systems

**System 1: Primitive Token Generation (Working)**
```
src/tokens/index.ts (getAllTokens)
    ↓
src/generators/TokenFileGenerator.ts
    ↓
output/DesignTokens.web.js (primitives only)
```

**System 2: Semantic Token Generation (Not Integrated)**
```
src/tokens/semantic/ShadowTokens.ts (shadow.dusk defined)
    ↓
src/build/platforms/WebShadowGenerator.ts (can generate CSS)
    ↓
[NOT CONNECTED TO MAIN GENERATION]
```

### Why This Matters

This isn't just about shadows - it affects **all semantic tokens**:

| Token Type | Source Exists | Generator Exists | Integrated |
|------------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| Semantic Shadows | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Semantic Typography | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Semantic Colors | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Semantic Spacing | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

The platform generation system needs a comprehensive solution for semantic tokens, not just a shadow-specific fix.

## What Was Actually Accomplished

Despite the blocking issue, **significant work was completed**:

### Semantic Token Level (Complete)

✅ **Token Definition:**
- `shadow.dusk` defined with correct primitive references
- Mathematical relationships preserved (offsetX: 6px, offsetY: 8px, blur: 12px)
- Baseline grid alignment maintained

✅ **Code Quality:**
- Tests updated and passing
- Type safety maintained
- No compilation errors

✅ **Documentation:**
- Requirements updated
- Design docs updated
- Completion docs created
- Tracy Weiss dedication in place

### Platform Generation Level (Blocked)

❌ **Web CSS:** Cannot generate `--shadow-dusk` custom properties
❌ **iOS Swift:** Cannot generate `static let dusk` constants
❌ **Android Kotlin:** Cannot generate Kotlin shadow constants

**The rename is successful** - only the infrastructure for generating platform code is missing.

---

## Recommended Path Forward

### Option 1: Create New Spec (Recommended)

**Spec: "Semantic Token Platform Generation"**

**Why this is the right approach:**
1. **Proper Design:** Semantic token generation deserves architectural design
2. **All Semantic Tokens:** Solves the problem for shadows, typography, colors, spacing
3. **Cross-Platform:** Ensures consistent approach across web, iOS, Android
4. **AI Collaboration:** Properly documented spec enables future AI agents to understand the system

**What the spec should address:**
- Architecture decision: How to integrate semantic tokens into generation
- Resolution strategy: How to resolve primitiveReferences during generation
- Output format: What developers actually import
- Validation approach: How to ensure correctness
- Cross-platform consistency: How semantic tokens translate to each platform

### Option 2: Quick Fix (Not Recommended)

**Use WebShadowGenerator separately:**
- Generate semantic shadows in separate CSS file
- Doesn't solve problem for other semantic tokens
- Creates technical debt
- Breaks unified output vision

**Counter-argument:** This is a band-aid that doesn't align with the "Rosetta Stone" vision of a unified, mathematically precise design system.

## Impact Assessment

### On This Spec

**Completed:**
- ✅ Task 1: Rename semantic token (afternoon → dusk)
- ✅ Task 2: Update tests
- ✅ Task 3: Update documentation
- ✅ Task 4: Validation

**Blocked:**
- ❌ Task 5.1: Regenerate web CSS
- ❌ Task 5.2: Regenerate iOS Swift
- ❌ Task 5.3: Regenerate Android Kotlin
- ❌ Task 5.4: Validate platform output

**Can Proceed:**
- ✅ Task 6: Tracy Weiss dedication (documentation only)

### On Overall System

**No regression:**
- Existing primitive token generation still works
- No breaking changes to current functionality
- Tests passing

**Identified gap:**
- Semantic token generation not implemented
- Need architectural solution
- Affects all semantic token types

---

## Subtask Status

### 5.1 Regenerate Web CSS - BLOCKED
- See: `task-5-1-blocking.md`
- Reason: Semantic tokens not in generation system

### 5.2 Regenerate iOS Swift - BLOCKED
- Same root cause as 5.1
- iOS semantic token generation not implemented

### 5.3 Regenerate Android Kotlin - BLOCKED
- Same root cause as 5.1
- Android semantic token generation not implemented

### 5.4 Validate Platform Output - BLOCKED
- Cannot validate output that cannot be generated
- Depends on 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 completion

---

## Validation (Not Applicable - Task Blocked)

Parent task cannot be validated because all subtasks are blocked.

**What would need to be validated if unblocked:**
- All platforms generate semantic shadow tokens with "dusk" naming
- Generated values match pre-rename output (6px 8px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15))
- Cross-platform consistency maintained
- No "afternoon" references in generated files

---

## Requirements Compliance

**Requirements addressed at semantic token level (complete):**
- ✅ Requirement 5.1: Web platform generation (token defined, generation blocked)
- ✅ Requirement 5.2: iOS platform generation (token defined, generation blocked)
- ✅ Requirement 5.3: Android platform generation (token defined, generation blocked)
- ✅ Requirement 5.4: Platform output validation (token valid, output blocked)
- ✅ Requirement 5.5: Cross-platform consistency (token consistent, generation blocked)

**Requirements blocked at infrastructure level:**
- ❌ Actual platform file generation with semantic tokens
- ❌ Verification of generated output
- ❌ Cross-platform output validation

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Systematic Approach:** Breaking down the rename into clear tasks helped identify the gap early
2. **Test-Driven:** Tests revealed that semantic tokens exist but aren't generated
3. **Honest Assessment:** Recognizing the architectural gap rather than forcing a quick fix

### What Was Discovered

1. **Architectural Gap:** Semantic token generation is a missing piece of infrastructure
2. **Scope Clarity:** The rename itself is complete - generation is a separate concern
3. **System Understanding:** Better understanding of how primitive vs semantic tokens flow through the system

### Future Considerations

1. **Spec Planning:** Future specs should verify infrastructure exists before planning tasks that depend on it
2. **Integration Testing:** Need end-to-end tests that verify semantic tokens generate correctly
3. **Documentation:** Need clear documentation of what's implemented vs what's planned

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Document blocking issue** (this document)
2. ✅ **Mark tasks 5.1-5.4 as blocked** in tasks.md
3. ⏭️ **Proceed to Task 6** (Tracy Weiss dedication)
4. 🔜 **Create new spec** for Semantic Token Platform Generation
5. 🔜 **Design semantic token generation architecture**
6. 🔜 **Implement semantic token generation**
7. 🔜 **Return to complete Task 5** once infrastructure exists

---

## Recommendation

**Proceed with Task 6** (Tracy Weiss dedication completion note) and consider this spec **partially complete**:

- ✅ Core work complete: Semantic token renamed successfully
- ❌ Infrastructure work blocked: Platform generation not implemented
- 📋 Action required: Create new spec for semantic token generation

The afternoon-to-dusk rename is **successful at the semantic token level**. Platform generation is a **separate architectural concern** that requires its own spec and implementation.

*This blocking documentation identifies the architectural gap preventing Task 5 completion and provides a clear path forward through a dedicated semantic token generation spec.*
