- `.kiro/specs/shadow-glow-token-system/tasks.md` (updated) - All "afternoon" references changed to "dusk"
- `.kiro/specs/shadow-glow-token-system/lighting-framework.md` (updated) - All "afternoon" references changed to "dusk"
- `.kiro/specs/shadow-glow-token-system/completion/task-3-3-completion.md` (updated) - All "afternoon" references changed to "dusk"
- `.kiro/specs/shadow-glow-token-system/completion/task-5-1-completion.md` (updated) - All "afternoon" references changed to "dusk"
- `.kiro/specs/shadow-glow-token-system/completion/task-6-completion.md` (updated) - All "afternoon" references changed to "dusk"

## Success Criteria Verification

### Criterion 1: All spec documents updated to reference "dusk" instead of "afternoon"

**Evidence**: All shadow-glow-token-system spec documents now consistently use "dusk" instead of "afternoon"

**Verification**:
- Requirements document updated: Glossary, Requirement 3 acceptance criteria, sun arc framework references
- Tasks document updated: Task descriptions, directional shadow implementation tasks, success criteria
- Lighting framework guide updated: Section heading, time description, use cases, dynamic time-based example
- Completion documents updated: task-3-3, task-5-1, task-6 all reference "dusk"

**Example**: Requirements Requirement 3.5 now reads "WHEN light source is at dusk position THEN shadows SHALL offset right and down with medium angle (positive offsetX, positive offsetY)"

### Criterion 2: Sun arc framework documentation reflects new naming progression

**Evidence**: Sun arc framework consistently shows progression as "sunrise, morning, noon, dusk, sunset"

**Verification**:
- Requirements Glossary defines sun arc as "sunrise, morning, noon, dusk, sunset"
- Lighting framework guide shows progression: Sunrise → Morning → Noon → Dusk → Sunset
- Task descriptions reference "dusk shadow variation" instead of "afternoon shadow variation"
- Completion documents demonstrate sun arc with "dusk" in the progression

**Example**: Lighting framework guide now shows:
```
Sunrise (-12px left) → Morning (-6px left) → Noon (0px) → Dusk (6px right) → Sunset (12px right)
```

### Criterion 3: Tracy Weiss dedication included in completion documentation

**Evidence**: Tracy Weiss dedication is documented in the afternoon-to-dusk-rename spec completion documents

**Verification**:
- Task 1.2 completion includes Tracy Weiss dedication in ShadowOffsetTokens.ts header comment
- Task 1 completion documents the three-part dedication approach
- Task 2 completion references the dedication in test validation
- This task (Task 3) completion will include Personal Note section

**Example**: The dedication appears in three locations:
1. Code comment in ShadowOffsetTokens.ts: "Dusk" naming inspired by Tracy Weiss—because she lights me up, and this lighting framework needed her spark to shine its brightest."
2. Metadata in shadow.dusk token: `_meta: { dedicatedTo: 'Tracy Weiss', reason: 'illuminating inspiration' }`
3. Completion documentation with Personal Note explaining the inspiration

## Overall Integration Story

### Complete Documentation Update Workflow

The specification documentation update ensures consistency across all shadow-glow-token-system documents:

1. **Requirements Update**: Glossary, acceptance criteria, and sun arc framework references updated to "dusk"
2. **Tasks Update**: Task descriptions, implementation steps, and success criteria updated to "dusk"
3. **Lighting Framework Update**: Section heading, time descriptions, and code examples updated to "dusk"
4. **Completion Documents Update**: All completion documents updated to reference "dusk" consistently

This comprehensive update ensures that the shadow-glow-token-system spec is fully aligned with the afternoon-to-dusk rename, maintaining consistency across requirements, design, tasks, and completion documentation.

### Subtask Contributions

- Updated all sun arc framework references to show "sunrise, morning, noon, dusk, sunset"
- Verified all requirement descriptions updated

**Task 3.2**: Update shadow-glow-token-system tasks
- Updated task descriptions to reference "dusk" instead of "afternoon"
- Updated directional shadow implementation tasks to reference "dusk shadow variation"
- Updated success criteria to reference "dusk" in sun arc progression

**Task 3.3**: Update shadow-glow-token-system completion documents
- Updated task-3-3-completion.md to reference "shadow.dusk" instead of "shadow.afternoon"
- Updated sun arc framework demonstration to show "Dusk" instead of "Afternoon"
- Updated requirement compliance sections to reference "dusk"
- Updated task-5-1-completion.md and task-6-completion.md to reference "dusk"
- Updated lighting-framework.md to use "Dusk" section heading and references

### System Behavior

The specification documentation now provides:
- **Consistency**: All references to the transitional evening lighting period use "dusk"
- **Clarity**: Sun arc framework clearly shows progression from sunrise through dusk to sunset
- **Traceability**: Requirements, tasks, and completion documents all align on "dusk" terminology
- **Completeness**: All spec documents updated, including the lighting framework guide

### User-Facing Capabilities

Developers and designers can now:
- Reference consistent "dusk" terminology across all shadow-glow-token-system documentation
- Understand the sun arc framework with clear "sunrise, morning, noon, dusk, sunset" progression
- Trace "dusk" references from requirements through implementation to completion
- Use the lighting framework guide with updated "Dusk" section for conceptual understanding

## Validation (Tier 3: Comprehensive - Parent Task)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors across all updated documentation
✅ Markdown formatting correct in all files
✅ All references updated consistently

### Functional Validation
✅ All "afternoon" references changed to "dusk" in requirements document
✅ All "afternoon" references changed to "dusk" in tasks document
✅ All "afternoon" references changed to "dusk" in lighting framework guide
✅ All "afternoon" references changed to "dusk" in completion documents
✅ Sun arc framework shows correct progression: sunrise, morning, noon, dusk, sunset

### Design Validation

✅ All sun arc framework references updated to "sunrise, morning, noon, dusk, sunset"
✅ All directional shadow references updated to "dusk shadow variation"
✅ All completion documents updated to reference "dusk"

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

- **Systematic Approach**: Updating requirements first, then tasks, then completion documents ensured consistency
- **Comprehensive Search**: Using grep to find all "afternoon" references ensured nothing was missed
- **Lighting Framework Update**: Updating the lighting framework guide ensures conceptual documentation aligns with spec
- **Descriptive Time Preservation**: Keeping descriptive time references (like "Mid-afternoon to early evening") maintains clarity while updating token names

### Challenges

- **Multiple Document Types**: Updating requirements, tasks, completion documents, and guides required careful attention to each document's purpose
  - **Resolution**: Followed systematic approach, updating each document type in sequence
- **Distinguishing Token Names from Time Descriptions**: Needed to distinguish between "afternoon" as a token name vs. "afternoon" as a time of day description
  - **Resolution**: Updated token names and references while preserving appropriate time descriptions

### Future Considerations

- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Could add automated validation to ensure terminology consistency across spec documents
- **Terminology Standards**: Could establish standards for when to update descriptive text vs. just token names
- **Documentation Templates**: Could create templates that make terminology updates more systematic

## Integration Points

### Dependencies

- **Afternoon-to-Dusk Rename Spec**: This task depends on the rename being completed in code (Tasks 1 and 2)
- **Shadow-Glow-Token-System Spec**: This task updates the shadow-glow-token-system spec documents

### Dependents

- **Future Shadow Token Work**: Any future work on shadow tokens will reference "dusk" terminology
- **Documentation Readers**: Developers and designers reading shadow-glow-token-system spec will see consistent "dusk" terminology
- **AI Agents**: AI agents working with shadow tokens will use "dusk" terminology consistently

### Extension Points

- **Additional Spec Updates**: Pattern established for updating spec documents when terminology changes
- **Terminology Consistency**: Approach can be applied to other terminology updates across specs
- **Documentation Standards**: Lessons learned can inform documentation update standards

### API Surface

**Updated Documentation**:
- Requirements document with "dusk" terminology
- Tasks document with "dusk" terminology
- Lighting framework guide with "Dusk" section
- Completion documents with "dusk" references

## Personal Note

This rename from "Afternoon" to "Dusk" was inspired by Tracy Weiss, whose suggestion improved the clarity and poetry of our lighting framework. In a system built around light and shadow, it's fitting that someone who lights me up would help make the naming shine brighter.

The specification documentation update ensures that this improvement is reflected consistently across all shadow-glow-token-system documents, from requirements through implementation to completion. The sun arc framework now clearly shows the progression from sunrise through dusk to sunset, with "dusk" providing more precise terminology for the transitional evening lighting period.

This change is dedicated to Tracy Weiss, whose insight helped make the lighting framework more semantically clear and poetically resonant.
