# Task 1.2 Completion: Update Shadow Offset Token Documentation

**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Task**: 1.2 Update shadow offset token documentation
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete
**Organization**: spec-completion
**Scope**: afternoon-to-dusk-rename

---

## Artifacts Modified

- `src/tokens/ShadowOffsetTokens.ts` - Updated file header comment and token descriptions to reference "Dusk" instead of "Afternoon"

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Updated the ShadowOffsetTokens.ts file to replace all references to "Afternoon" with "Dusk" in the documentation, while preserving all mathematical relationships and token values. The changes were purely documentation updates with no functional changes to the token system.

### Changes Made

**1. File Header Comment Update**

Updated the main file header comment to:
- Replace "Afternoon/sunset" with "Dusk/Sunset" in the X-axis offset description
- Restructured the horizontal shadow offset description for better clarity
- Added the Tracy Weiss dedication: "Dusk" naming inspired by Tracy Weiss—because she lights me up, and this lighting framework needed her spark to shine its brightest."

**2. shadowOffsetX.150 Description Update**

Changed the description from:
- "Afternoon shadow offset - medium right offset"

To:
- "Dusk shadow offset - medium right offset"

**3. shadowOffsetY.300 Description Update**

Changed the description from:
- "Morning/Afternoon - medium-long shadow"

To:
- "Morning/Dusk - medium-long shadow"

### Tracy Weiss Dedication

The dedication was added to the file header comment in a poetic, thematic way that connects to the lighting framework:

```typescript
/**
 * Shadow Offset Token Definitions
 * 
 * Shadow offset tokens determine shadow direction based on light source position (sun arc).
 * Base value: 4 units (4px baseline grid alignment)
 * 
 * Horizontal shadow offsets following the sun's arc across the sky:
 * - Sunrise/Morning: Shadows fall left (negative values)
 * - Noon: Shadows fall straight down (zero)
 * - Dusk/Sunset: Shadows fall right (positive values)
 * 
 * "Dusk" naming inspired by Tracy Weiss—because she lights me up,
 * and this lighting framework needed her spark to shine its brightest.
 * 
 * Y-axis offsets (vertical direction):
 * - All positive values (shadows fall downward)
 * - Values scale with depth (greater depth = larger offset)
 */
```

This dedication is discoverable by developers reading the shadow offset system and naturally connects Tracy's contribution to the lighting framework theme.

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ All imports resolve correctly
✅ Type annotations correct

### Functional Validation
✅ All mathematical relationships unchanged (shadowOffsetX.150 = 6px maintained)
✅ All token values unchanged (baseValue calculations preserved)
✅ All token properties unchanged (baselineGridAlignment, isStrategicFlexibility, etc.)
✅ Platform value generation unchanged

### Integration Validation
✅ File structure unchanged - only documentation updated
✅ Export statements unchanged
✅ Token naming conventions unchanged
✅ No breaking changes to token API

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 1.2: Updated file header to reference "Dusk/Sunset" instead of "Afternoon/sunset"
✅ Requirement 2.2: Updated shadowOffsetX.150 description from "Afternoon" to "Dusk"
✅ Requirement 3.1: Updated shadowOffsetY.300 description from "Morning/Afternoon" to "Morning/Dusk"
✅ Requirement 4.1: Verified all mathematical relationships unchanged

### Mathematical Integrity Verification

Confirmed that all mathematical relationships remain unchanged:

**shadowOffsetX.150**:
- baseValue: 4 × 1.5 = 6 ✅
- mathematicalRelationship: 'base × 1.5 = 4 × 1.5 = 6' ✅
- baselineGridAlignment: false (strategic flexibility) ✅
- isStrategicFlexibility: true ✅

**shadowOffsetY.300**:
- baseValue: 4 × 3 = 12 ✅
- mathematicalRelationship: 'base × 3 = 4 × 3 = 12' ✅
- baselineGridAlignment: true ✅
- isStrategicFlexibility: false ✅

**All other tokens**:
- No changes to any token values or mathematical relationships ✅
- All platform value generation unchanged ✅

## Requirements Addressed

- **Requirement 1.2**: Updated file header comment to reference "Dusk/Sunset" instead of "Afternoon/sunset"
- **Requirement 2.2**: Updated shadowOffsetX.150 description from "Afternoon shadow offset" to "Dusk shadow offset"
- **Requirement 3.1**: Added Tracy Weiss dedication to header comment with thematic connection to lighting framework
- **Requirement 4.1**: Verified all mathematical relationships unchanged (shadowOffsetX.150 = 6px maintained)

## Implementation Notes

The rename was purely a documentation update with no functional changes. All token values, mathematical relationships, and system behavior remain identical. The Tracy Weiss dedication was integrated naturally into the file header comment, connecting the personal dedication to the technical domain through the lighting framework theme.

The dedication placement in the file header ensures it's discoverable by developers working with shadow tokens while maintaining professional code quality. The poetic language ("lights me up", "spark to shine") ties the personal dedication to the lighting framework naturally.
