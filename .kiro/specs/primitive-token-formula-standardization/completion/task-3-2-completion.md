# Task 3.2 Completion: Verify Strategic Flexibility Tokens Preserved

**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Task**: 3.2 Verify strategic flexibility tokens preserved
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `src/tokens/__tests__/RadiusStrategicFlexibilityValidation.test.ts` - Comprehensive validation tests for strategic flexibility token preservation

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Verified that all four strategic flexibility tokens in RadiusTokens remain unchanged after the formula refactoring in task 3.1:

1. **radius075**: Hard value of 6 preserved
2. **radius125**: Hard value of 10 preserved
3. **radius250**: Hard value of 20 preserved
4. **radiusFull**: Hard value of 9999 preserved

All tokens maintain their `isStrategicFlexibility: true` flags and original mathematical relationship descriptions.

### Strategic Flexibility Tokens Verified

**radius075**:
- baseValue: 6 (hard value, not formula) ✓
- isStrategicFlexibility: true ✓
- mathematicalRelationship: 'base × 0.75 = 8 × 0.75 = 6' ✓

**radius125**:
- baseValue: 10 (hard value, not formula) ✓
- isStrategicFlexibility: true ✓
- mathematicalRelationship: 'base × 1.25 = 8 × 1.25 = 10' ✓

**radius250**:
- baseValue: 20 (hard value, not formula) ✓
- isStrategicFlexibility: true ✓
- mathematicalRelationship: 'base × 2.5 = 8 × 2.5 = 20' ✓

**radiusFull**:
- baseValue: 9999 (hard value, not formula) ✓
- isStrategicFlexibility: true ✓
- mathematicalRelationship: 'special case = 9999 (effectively infinite)' ✓

### Validation Tests Created

Created comprehensive test suite with 16 tests covering:

1. **Individual Token Verification** (12 tests):
   - Each strategic flexibility token's baseValue
   - Each token's isStrategicFlexibility flag
   - Each token's mathematical relationship description

2. **Helper Function Verification** (3 tests):
   - getStrategicFlexibilityRadiusTokens returns exactly 4 tokens
   - All 4 strategic tokens are included in the result
   - All returned tokens have isStrategicFlexibility = true

3. **Non-Strategic Token Verification** (1 test):
   - All 8 non-strategic tokens have isStrategicFlexibility = false

### Key Observations

**Strategic Flexibility Pattern Preserved**:
- Strategic flexibility tokens use hard values (not formulas)
- This pattern enables usage tracking for the ≥80% appropriate usage requirement
- The pattern was correctly preserved during formula refactoring

**Consistency with SpacingTokens**:
- RadiusTokens follows the same strategic flexibility pattern as SpacingTokens
- Both use hard values for strategic flexibility tokens
- Both maintain isStrategicFlexibility flags for tracking

**radiusFull Special Case**:
- radiusFull uses 9999 as a special case for "effectively infinite" radius
- This creates perfect circles/pills regardless of element size
- Correctly marked as strategic flexibility due to its special nature

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ All imports resolve correctly
✅ Type annotations correct

### Functional Validation
✅ radius075 preserves hard value of 6 with isStrategicFlexibility = true
✅ radius125 preserves hard value of 10 with isStrategicFlexibility = true
✅ radius250 preserves hard value of 20 with isStrategicFlexibility = true
✅ radiusFull preserves hard value of 9999 with isStrategicFlexibility = true
✅ All mathematical relationship descriptions preserved
✅ getStrategicFlexibilityRadiusTokens returns exactly 4 tokens
✅ All non-strategic tokens have isStrategicFlexibility = false

### Integration Validation
✅ Strategic flexibility tokens integrate correctly with token system
✅ Helper function getStrategicFlexibilityRadiusTokens works correctly
✅ Pattern consistent with SpacingTokens strategic flexibility approach

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 4.1: Strategic flexibility tokens excluded from refactoring
✅ Requirement 4.2: Existing baseValue patterns preserved unchanged
✅ Requirement 4.3: isStrategicFlexibility flags maintained
✅ Requirement 4.4: All strategic flexibility tokens verified unchanged
