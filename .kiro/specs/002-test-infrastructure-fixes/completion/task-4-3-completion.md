## Registry Accuracy

The issues registry now accurately reflects the state of the project:

**Before This Update**:
- 16 resolved issues (84.2% resolution rate)
- 3 active issues (#018, #023, #024)
- Test infrastructure issues preventing reliable testing

**After This Update**:
- 19 resolved issues (100% resolution rate)
- 0 active issues
- All test infrastructure issues resolved
- Complete verification evidence for each resolution

## Impact

**Test Suite Health**: Registry now reflects that all Phase 1 issues are resolved, including the three test infrastructure issues that were preventing reliable automated testing.

**Documentation Accuracy**: The registry serves as the authoritative record of project issues. Updating it to reflect the actual state ensures developers can trust the registry when planning future work.
