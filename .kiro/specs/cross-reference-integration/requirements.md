# Requirements Document: Cross-Reference Integration

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Spec**: cross-reference-integration
**Status**: Requirements Phase
**Dependencies**: None (improves existing documentation)

---

## Introduction

This specification establishes cross-reference standards and integrates cross-references across active documentation to create efficient navigation within current project documentation. The goal is to enable developers and AI agents to navigate between related documentation (guides, specs, completion docs) without cross-referencing to historical preserved knowledge.

Currently, documentation exists in isolation - guides don't reference each other, completion docs don't link to guides they created, and there's no master overview connecting token files to their documentation. This creates navigation friction and makes it difficult to discover related documentation.

**Key principles**:
- **Internal Navigation**: Cross-references connect current, active documentation (guides, specs, completion docs)
- **Documentation vs Code Distinction**: Cross-references belong in documentation, not production code
- **Historical Separation**: Preserved knowledge is historical foundation, not active reference material

---

## Glossary

- **Cross-Reference System**: The DesignerPunk documentation linking system that connects related concepts across active documents using markdown links
- **Active Documentation**: Current, in-use documentation including spec guides, completion docs, and overview documents (excludes historical preserved knowledge)
- **Documentation Guides**: Spec-specific guides that explain implementation patterns (e.g., compositional-color-guide.md, strategic-flexibility-guide.md, inline-emphasis-guide.md)
- **Token System Overview**: A master document at `docs/token-system-overview.md` that maps token files to their documentation guides
- **Production Code**: Executable code files that run in production (token definition files, component files, utility files)
- **File Organization Standards**: The steering document at `.kiro/steering/File Organization Standards.md` that defines documentation practices
- **Completion Documents**: Task completion documentation in `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/` that documents implementation approach and decisions
- **Spec Documents**: Requirements, design, and tasks documents in `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/` that define feature specifications

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Cross-Reference Standards Documentation

**User Story**: As an AI agent, I want clear standards for when and how to use cross-references so that I create consistent, well-connected documentation across all specs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN File Organization Standards is updated, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL include a "Cross-Reference Standards" section
2. WHEN Cross-Reference Standards are documented, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL specify where cross-references MUST be used (documentation, documentation guides, spec documents, completion documents, README files)
3. WHEN Cross-Reference Standards are documented, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL specify where cross-references MUST NOT be used (production code files including token definitions, component implementations, utility functions)
4. WHEN Cross-Reference Standards are documented, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL provide formatting patterns showing the "reference, then explain" approach
5. WHEN Cross-Reference Standards are documented, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL provide anti-patterns showing what NOT to do (re-explaining principles without cross-references)
6. WHEN Cross-Reference Standards are documented, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL explain the rationale for documentation vs code distinction

### Requirement 2: Token System Overview Document

**User Story**: As a developer or AI agent, I want a master document that maps token files to their documentation so that I can understand the token system without reading every token file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Token System Overview is created, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL create the document at `docs/token-system-overview.md`
2. WHEN Token System Overview documents primitive tokens, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL list each primitive token file with its file path and brief description
3. WHEN Token System Overview documents semantic tokens, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL list each semantic token file with its file path and brief description
4. WHEN Token System Overview documents typography tokens, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL link to typography-token-expansion Documentation Guides (compositional-color-guide.md, strategic-flexibility-guide.md, inline-emphasis-guide.md, migration-guide.md)
5. WHEN Token System Overview is complete, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL provide navigation from token types to their related Documentation Guides

### Requirement 3: Typography Guide Cross-Reference Integration

**User Story**: As a developer reading typography documentation, I want cross-references to related guides so that I can navigate between related concepts efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compositional-color-guide.md is updated, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL add cross-reference to strategic-flexibility-guide.md where discussing token design decisions
2. WHEN strategic-flexibility-guide.md is updated, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL add cross-reference to compositional-color-guide.md where discussing compositional architecture
3. WHEN inline-emphasis-guide.md is updated, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL add cross-reference to compositional-color-guide.md where discussing why emphasis isn't in tokens
4. WHEN migration-guide.md is updated, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL add cross-reference to other guides where discussing renamed tokens
5. WHEN Documentation Guides are updated with cross-references, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL add "Related Guides" section listing related Documentation Guides
6. WHEN Documentation Guides add cross-references, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL use descriptive link text explaining why the related guide is relevant

### Requirement 4: Cross-Reference Pattern Consistency

**User Story**: As an AI agent, I want consistent cross-reference patterns across all Active Documentation so that I can apply the same patterns when creating new documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cross-references are added to documentation, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL use relative paths from the document location
2. WHEN cross-references link to specific sections, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL use section anchors (e.g., `#compositional-architecture`)
3. WHEN cross-references are formatted, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL use markdown link syntax with descriptive link text explaining relevance
4. WHEN multiple related guides are referenced, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL group them in a "Related Guides" or "Related Documentation" section
5. WHEN cross-references are added, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL maintain existing content and add cross-references as navigation aids, not content replacement

### Requirement 5: Documentation vs Code Distinction

**User Story**: As an AI agent, I want clear guidance on the distinction between documentation (where cross-references belong) and Production Code (where they don't) so that I don't add noise to executable code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Cross-Reference Standards are documented, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL explicitly state that Production Code files MUST NOT include cross-references
2. WHEN Cross-Reference Standards are documented, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL explain that token definition files are executable Production Code, not documentation
3. WHEN Cross-Reference Standards are documented, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL explain that code comments should be brief and focused on implementation, not architectural rationale
4. WHEN Cross-Reference Standards are documented, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL explain that architectural rationale belongs in Documentation Guides, not Production Code files
5. WHEN Cross-Reference Standards provide examples, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL show both correct usage (documentation) and incorrect usage (code) with clear labels

### Requirement 6: Completion Document Cross-References

**User Story**: As a developer reviewing completed work, I want completion documents to reference the guides they created so that I can navigate from implementation to documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN completion documents reference created guides, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL link to the specific guide files created during that task
2. WHEN completion documents document implementation decisions, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL reference related guides where those decisions are explained in detail
3. WHEN completion documents are created, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL include a "Related Documentation" section listing guides created or updated by that task
4. WHEN guides are created by a task, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL ensure bidirectional navigation (completion doc → guide, guide → completion doc if relevant)
5. WHEN completion documents reference guides, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL use relative paths from the completion document location

### Requirement 7: Documentation Navigation Efficiency

**User Story**: As a developer or AI agent, I want efficient navigation between related documentation so that I can discover relevant information without manual searching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Documentation Guides discuss related concepts, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL provide cross-references to related Documentation Guides
2. WHEN Token System Overview lists token types, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL provide cross-references to relevant Documentation Guides
3. WHEN Completion Documents document created artifacts, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL provide cross-references to Documentation Guides created by that task
4. WHEN cross-references are added, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL enable navigation in 2 clicks or less between related documentation
5. WHEN new documentation is created, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL follow established cross-reference patterns for consistency

### Requirement 8: Cross-Reference Validation

**User Story**: As a quality assurance process, I want validation that cross-references are working correctly so that Active Documentation remains navigable and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cross-references are added to Active Documentation, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL validate that all links resolve to existing documents
2. WHEN cross-references use section anchors, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL validate that section anchors exist in target documents
3. WHEN cross-references use relative paths, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL validate that paths are correct from document location
4. WHEN Production Code files are checked, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL validate that no cross-references exist in token definition files, component files, or utility files
5. WHEN validation is complete, THE Cross-Reference System SHALL document validation results showing link integrity and pattern consistency

*This requirements document establishes the foundation for efficient navigation within active documentation through consistent cross-reference patterns, while maintaining the distinction between documentation (where cross-references belong) and production code (where they don't). Preserved knowledge remains as historical foundation but is not actively cross-referenced.*
