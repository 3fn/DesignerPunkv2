**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Task**: 5. Create Documentation Guides
**Type**: Parent
**Status**: Complete

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/specs/border-width-tokens/usage-patterns-guide.md` - Comprehensive guide for using border width tokens in component design

### Documentation Architecture

The documentation guides follow a clear architecture that supports different learning paths:

**For Developers Learning the System**:
1. Start with Usage Patterns Guide to understand when to use each token
2. Review Focus Indicator Guide for accessibility-critical patterns
3. Reference Integration Examples Guide for implementation details

**For Developers Implementing Components**:
1. Check Usage Patterns Guide for component-specific patterns
2. Reference Integration Examples Guide for code examples
3. Consult Focus Indicator Guide for focus state implementation

**For Developers Migrating Existing Code**:
1. Review Integration Examples Guide for migration strategies
2. Check Usage Patterns Guide for anti-patterns to avoid
3. Reference Focus Indicator Guide for platform-appropriate patterns

### Cross-Reference Network

All guides include comprehensive cross-references following the File Organization Standards:

**Related Guides Section Format**:

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

**Concept-Based Documentation Approach**:
- Explaining why (rationale) in addition to how (implementation) helps developers make informed decisions
- Anti-patterns section prevents common mistakes by showing what not to do
- Decision framework provides clear criteria for choosing appropriate tokens

**Platform-Specific Examples**:
- Providing code examples in multiple languages (CSS, Swift, Kotlin) makes guides immediately actionable
- Platform-specific considerations address real-world implementation challenges
- Cross-platform consistency patterns help maintain visual unity

**Cross-Reference Network**:
- Related Guides sections at the beginning help readers discover relevant documentation
- Bidirectional linking creates a cohesive documentation network
- Relevance explanations help readers decide which links to follow

**Accessibility Integration**:
- Documenting WCAG requirements alongside implementation patterns ensures accessibility is not an afterthought
- Platform-native focus patterns respect user accessibility preferences
- Links to official accessibility resources provide authoritative guidance

### Challenges

**Balancing Detail and Readability**:
- Challenge: Providing comprehensive examples without overwhelming readers
- Resolution: Used progressive disclosure - overview first, then detailed examples, then edge cases
- Future consideration: Consider creating quick reference guides for experienced developers

**Platform Differences**:
- Challenge: Documenting platform-specific patterns while maintaining cross-platform consistency
- Resolution: Emphasized consistent visual weight (1px/pt/dp, 2px/pt/dp, 4px/pt/dp) while respecting platform conventions
- Future consideration: Create platform-specific quick start guides

**Cross-Reference Maintenance**:
- Challenge: Ensuring cross-references remain valid as documentation evolves
- Resolution: Used relative paths and followed File Organization Standards
- Future consideration: Implement automated link validation in CI/CD pipeline

### Future Considerations

**Interactive Examples**:
- Consider creating interactive code examples (CodeSandbox, SwiftUI Playgrounds, Jetpack Compose Playground)
- Would allow developers to experiment with border width tokens in real-time
- Could demonstrate visual differences between borderDefault, borderEmphasis, and borderHeavy

**Video Tutorials**:
- Consider creating video tutorials demonstrating border width token usage
- Would complement written documentation for visual learners
- Could show real-world component implementation workflows

**Component Library Integration**:
- Consider creating example component libraries using border width tokens
- Would provide reference implementations for common components
- Could serve as starting point for teams adopting the system

**AI Agent Optimization**:
- Documentation is written for human developers but should also be AI-readable
- Consider adding structured metadata for AI agent consumption
- Could enable AI agents to provide more accurate guidance on token usage
