# Requirements Document: Cross-Platform Build System

**Date**: January 10, 2025  
**Spec**: F2 - Cross-Platform Build System  
**Status**: Requirements Phase  
**Dependencies**: F1 - Mathematical Token System (Complete)

---

## Introduction

The Cross-Platform Build System (F2) implements True Native Architecture's build-time platform separation philosophy, enabling developers to build native applications for iOS (Swift + SwiftUI), Android (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose), and Web (Web Components + Lit) from a unified codebase while maintaining mathematical consistency through the Mathematical Token System (F1).

This system eliminates runtime platform detection overhead, generates platform-specific optimized builds, and maintains cross-platform consistency through unified interface contracts and mathematical token integration.

**Key Architectural Principles**:
- Build-time platform separation (no runtime detection)
- Platform-specific code generation from unified interfaces
- Mathematical token integration across all platforms
- Native technology for each platform (Swift, Kotlin, Lit)
- Unified developer experience with platform-specific optimizations

7. WHEN token conversion occurs THEN mathematical relationships SHALL be preserved across platforms
8. WHEN strategic flexibility tokens are used THEN the system SHALL maintain their values across platforms
9. WHEN tokens are integrated THEN the system SHALL validate mathematical consistency using F1 validation

### Requirement 4: Unified Interface Contracts

2. WHEN implementing platform-specific code THEN the system SHALL validate that interfaces match across platforms
3. WHEN component APIs differ THEN the system SHALL generate build errors with clear explanations
4. WHEN interface contracts are validated THEN the system SHALL check method signatures, property names, and types
5. WHEN building components THEN the system SHALL ensure behavioral consistency across platforms
6. WHEN interface validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages indicating which platform deviates

### Requirement 5: Platform-Specific Optimizations

**User Story**: As a developer, I want platform-specific implementations to leverage native capabilities, so that performance and user experience are optimized for each platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for iOS THEN the system SHALL support SwiftUI-specific optimizations (SF Symbols, native animations, etc.)
2. WHEN building for Android THEN the system SHALL support Jetpack Compose-specific optimizations (Material Design integration, native animations, etc.)
3. WHEN building for Web THEN the system SHALL support Web Components-specific optimizations (Shadow DOM, custom elements, etc.)
4. WHEN platform optimizations are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain unified interface contracts
5. WHEN platform-specific features are used THEN the system SHALL document platform differences
6. WHEN optimizations are applied THEN the system SHALL validate that mathematical token relationships are preserved

### Requirement 6: Build Configuration and Orchestration

**User Story**: As a developer, I want a simple build configuration system, so that I can specify target platforms and build options without complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring builds THEN developers SHALL be able to specify target platform via CLI flags, environment variables, or configuration files
2. WHEN multiple platforms are targeted THEN the system SHALL support parallel or sequential build execution
3. WHEN build configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with suggestions
4. WHEN builds are executed THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback and timing information
5. WHEN builds complete THEN the system SHALL report success/failure status for each platform
6. WHEN build errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages with context
7. WHEN builds succeed THEN the system SHALL output platform-specific packages to configured directories

### Requirement 7: Cross-Platform Validation

**User Story**: As a quality engineer, I want automated validation that components work consistently across platforms, so that cross-platform bugs are caught early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN builds complete THEN the system SHALL validate that all platforms generated successfully
2. WHEN validating builds THEN the system SHALL check that mathematical token values are consistent across platforms
3. WHEN validating builds THEN the system SHALL verify that interface contracts match across platforms
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed reports indicating which platforms or components failed
5. WHEN mathematical inconsistencies are detected THEN the system SHALL report specific token values that differ
6. WHEN interface mismatches are detected THEN the system SHALL report specific API differences
7. WHEN all validations pass THEN the system SHALL generate a validation report confirming cross-platform consistency

### Requirement 8: Development Workflow Integration

**User Story**: As a developer, I want the build system to integrate with my development workflow, so that I can iterate quickly during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

7. WHEN integrating with CI/CD THEN the system SHALL support automated builds for all platforms

### Requirement 9: Token Selection Priority and Component Token Support

**User Story**: As a designer, I want the build system to follow a clear token selection priority (semantic → primitive → component), so that existing tokens are leveraged first and component tokens are only created when mathematically necessary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting tokens for a component THEN the system SHALL follow this priority order:
   - First: Attempt to use semantic tokens (space.inset.small, color.primary, etc.)
   - Second: Attempt to use primitive tokens (space100, space125, color.blue500, etc.)
   - Third: Create component token only if semantic and primitive tokens cannot achieve design requirements
2. WHEN semantic tokens satisfy design requirements THEN the system SHALL use semantic tokens and document the selection
3. WHEN semantic tokens don't work but primitive tokens do THEN the system SHALL use primitive tokens and document why semantic tokens were insufficient
4. WHEN neither semantic nor primitive tokens work THEN the system SHALL create component tokens and document the mathematical reasoning
5. WHEN component tokens are created THEN the system SHALL generate them alongside primitive and semantic tokens
6. WHEN component tokens are generated THEN the system SHALL follow the same cross-platform conversion rules as primitive tokens
7. WHEN component tokens reference primitive tokens THEN the system SHALL maintain those references
8. WHEN component tokens are standalone values THEN the system SHALL document why existing tokens were mathematically insufficient
9. WHEN component tokens are used THEN the system SHALL track usage to identify patterns that might warrant new primitive tokens
10. WHEN token selection occurs THEN the system SHALL validate that the selected token maintains mathematical consistency

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Recovery
