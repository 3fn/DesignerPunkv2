## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Simultaneous Platform Builds

```typescript
const executor = new ParallelExecutor();
const result = await executor.execute(
  ['ios', 'android', 'web'],
  buildPlatform
);
```

- Executes multiple platform builds in parallel using `Promise.allSettled`
- Ensures all builds complete regardless of individual failures
- Significantly faster than sequential execution

### 2. Build Process Coordination

- **Promise-based coordination**: Uses Promise.allSettled for reliable parallel execution
- **Result aggregation**: Collects and aggregates results from all platform builds
- **Status tracking**: Tracks success/failure counts and completion status
- **Metadata preservation**: Maintains individual build metadata and warnings

### 3. Platform-Specific Build Failure Handling

```typescript
// Handles failures gracefully
const result = await executor.execute(platforms, buildFn);

// Failed builds have detailed error information
const failedBuild = result.results.find(r => !r.success);
console.log(failedBuild.errors[0].message);
console.log(failedBuild.errors[0].suggestions);
```

- Continues building other platforms after individual failures
- Provides detailed error information with actionable suggestions
- Creates structured BuildError objects with context
- Supports continueOnFailure option for different failure strategies

### 4. Result Aggregation

```typescript
interface ParallelExecutionResult {
  results: BuildResult[];        // All individual results
  totalDuration: number;         // Wall-clock time
  successCount: number;          // Number of successful builds
  failureCount: number;          // Number of failed builds
  allCompleted: boolean;         // Whether all builds completed
}
```

- Aggregates results from all platform builds
- Calculates overall metrics (success/failure counts)
- Measures total execution time (wall-clock, not cumulative)
- Tracks completion status

### 5. Advanced Features

#### Concurrency Control
```typescript
const executor = new ParallelExecutor({ maxConcurrency: 2 });
```
- Limits number of simultaneous builds
- Useful for resource-constrained environments
- Executes builds in batches when limit specified

#### Timeout Handling
```typescript
const executor = new ParallelExecutor({ buildTimeout: 5 * 60 * 1000 });
```
- Prevents builds from running indefinitely
- Configurable timeout per build
- Creates timeout error with clear messaging

#### Cancellation Support
```typescript
const executionPromise = executor.execute(platforms, buildFn);
// Later...
executor.cancel();
```
- Allows user-initiated cancellation
- Marks cancelled builds with appropriate errors
- Cleans up resources properly

#### Failure Strategy Options
```typescript
const executor = new ParallelExecutor({ continueOnFailure: false });
```
- Continue on failure (default): All builds attempted
- Stop on failure: Stops after first failure in batch

## Design Decisions

### 1. Promise.allSettled vs Promise.all

**Decision**: Use `Promise.allSettled`

**Rationale**:
- Ensures all builds complete regardless of individual failures
- Provides results for both successful and failed builds
- Aligns with "continue on failure" philosophy
- Better error reporting and debugging

### 2. Wall-Clock Time for Total Duration

**Decision**: Measure total duration as wall-clock time, not cumulative build time

**Rationale**:
- Reflects actual time user waits for builds
- Demonstrates parallel execution benefits
- More intuitive for performance metrics
- Matches user expectations

### 3. Timeout and Cancellation Implementation

**Decision**: Use Promise.race with cleanup in finally block

**Rationale**:
- Prevents resource leaks from timers
- Ensures proper cleanup on all exit paths
- Supports both timeout and cancellation
- Clean, maintainable implementation

### 4. Concurrency Control Strategy

**Decision**: Batch execution when concurrency limited

**Rationale**:
- Simple and predictable behavior
- Easy to reason about resource usage
- Supports both unlimited and limited concurrency
- Flexible for different environments

### 5. Error Structure

**Decision**: Use BuildError interface with detailed context

**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing build system error handling
- Provides actionable suggestions for users
- Includes context for debugging
- Supports error categorization

## Integration Points

### BuildOrchestrator Integration

The ParallelExecutor is designed to be used by BuildOrchestrator:

```typescript
// In BuildOrchestrator
private async buildParallel(platforms: Platform[]): Promise<BuildResult[]> {
  const executor = new ParallelExecutor();
  const result = await executor.execute(platforms, platform => 
    this.buildPlatform(platform)
  );
  return result.results;
}
```

### Platform Builder Integration

Works seamlessly with existing platform builders:
- iOSBuilder
- AndroidBuilder  
- WebBuilder

Each builder returns a BuildResult that ParallelExecutor aggregates.

## Performance Characteristics

### Parallel Execution Benefits

For 3 platforms with 100ms build time each:
- **Sequential**: ~300ms total
- **Parallel**: ~100ms total (3x faster)

### Concurrency Control

With maxConcurrency=2 and 3 platforms:
- First batch: 2 platforms in parallel
- Second batch: 1 platform
- Total time: ~150ms (vs 300ms sequential)

### Resource Management

- Configurable concurrency limits prevent resource exhaustion
- Timeout prevents runaway builds
- Cancellation allows user control
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
