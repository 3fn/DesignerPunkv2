# Task 6.1 Completion: Create Token Quick Reference Structure

**Date**: 2025-12-30
**Task**: 6.1 Create Token Quick Reference structure
**Type**: Setup
**Status**: Complete
**Organization**: spec-completion
**Scope**: 033-steering-documentation-enhancements

---

## What Was Done

Created the Token Quick Reference steering document with the required structure:

1. **Created file**: `.kiro/steering/Token Quick Reference.md`
2. **Added front matter**: `inclusion: always` as specified in design
3. **Created section headers** per design spec:
   - Purpose
   - Token Documentation Map (with complete routing table)
   - Common Patterns (placeholder for Task 6.3)
   - MCP Query Examples (placeholder for Task 6.3)

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/steering/Token Quick Reference.md` - Token documentation routing table

## Validation (Tier 1: Minimal)

- ✅ File exists at `.kiro/steering/Token Quick Reference.md`
- ✅ Front matter contains `inclusion: always`
- ✅ All section headers present per design spec
- ✅ Token Documentation Map table includes all 14 token types

## Requirements Addressed

- **Requirement 3.6**: THE Token Quick Reference SHALL use `inclusion: always` since it's a small routing table needed frequently

## Notes

- Common Patterns and MCP Query Examples sections contain placeholders to be completed in Task 6.3
- Token Documentation Map includes all token types now that Tasks 3-5 have filled documentation gaps
