- `system-integration-points.md` - Key integration areas for future detailed design
- `knowledge-gap-resolution-input.md` - User input on knowledge gap priorities and resolution approaches

### Coordination Framework Methodology

**Process-First Tool Development Strategy**:
- Established clear principle that tools are created only after process limitations are identified through real-world usage
- Integrated understanding that Kiro's steering and hooks capabilities should be leveraged for automation of proven patterns
- Documented tool development as process enhancement rather than process replacement
- Captured user clarification that "we're going to create and use tools AFTER we determine a clear need for them"

**Parallel Development with Preliminary Guidelines**:
- Designed coordination framework enabling systems to develop simultaneously with preliminary guidelines
- Established guideline refinement process based on real-world implementation experience
- Created coordination strategy preventing sequential bottlenecks while maintaining quality
- Integrated user input on parallel development with mid-development refinement approach

**Skepticism Default with Progressive Relaxation**:
- Implemented skepticism protocols for architectural decisions with broad system impact
- Established progressive relaxation criteria requiring explicit human consent
- Created conflict detection and resolution processes for coordination decisions
- Integrated user input on skepticism default during pre and early-development phase

### Interactive Knowledge Gap Input Process

**User Input Integration Process**:
Throughout coordination framework development, user input was solicited and integrated on critical knowledge gaps:

**G1.1 Mathematical Token System Implementation**:
- **User Decision**: Process-based validation over real-time tooling
- **Rationale**: "Good process before great tools" - prove the process works before building tools to automate it
- **Integration**: Coordination framework prioritizes process-based validation with tool development as optional enhancement

**G2.1 Cross-Platform Mathematical Consistency**:
- **User Decision**: Preliminary guidelines with parallel development and mid-development refinement
- **Rationale**: Perfect consistency impractical, strategic flexibility tokens handle challenges, parallel development more efficient
- **Integration**: Coordination framework enables parallel development with preliminary guidelines refined during implementation

**G3.1 AI Collaboration Scope**:
- **User Decision**: Skepticism default with progressive relaxation as foundations solidify
- **Rationale**: Early development requires cautious approach, skepticism can be progressively alleviated, AI should ask questions when uncertain
- **Integration**: Coordination framework implements skepticism default with explicit consent requirements for relaxation

**Process-First Validation Strategy**:
- **User Decision**: Process-based validation through task success criteria rather than real-time tooling
- **Rationale**: Tool complexity vs process effectiveness, flexibility for edge cases, human judgment for false positives/negatives
- **Integration**: All coordination uses process-based validation rather than dependence on specialized tooling

### Strategic Direction Evolution Integration

**Build-Time Unit Application Evolution**:
- Integrated token system with Translation Providers generating platform-specific units
- Coordinated F1 → F3 → F2 chain for build-time optimization without runtime conversion overhead
- Established coordination between token generation, component development, and build system packaging

**Mathematical Flexibility Validation Refinement**:
- Integrated strategic flexibility tokens (6px, 10px, 20px) as Pass-level validation within coordination framework
- Coordinated validation system to distinguish strategic flexibility from deviation patterns
- Established AI agent control for unauthorized flexibility token creation through coordination processes

**AI Collaboration Framework Scope Refinement**:
- Integrated architectural decision-focused skepticism into coordination framework
- Established coordination decision classification distinguishing architectural from implementation decisions
- Created progressive relaxation coordination with foundation solidification validation

**Documentation Pattern Evolution**:
- Integrated living principle documentation with feedback-driven evolution into coordination framework
- Established documentation as living system with built-in improvement mechanisms
- Created coordination validation focusing on principle quality rather than implementation output quality

### System Relationship Mapping Integration

**Foundation Layer Coordination**:
- **F1 Mathematical Token System + Translation Providers**: Established as foundational semantic token provider enabling all dependent systems through process-first approach

## Lessons Learned and Insights

### Process-First Tool Development Insights

**Key Learning**: The distinction between "process-first" and "no tools" is critical - the framework establishes clear needs through proven processes before creating tools to enhance those processes, not avoiding tools entirely.

**Implementation Insight**: Kiro's steering and hooks capabilities provide natural automation opportunities for proven coordination patterns without over-engineering.

**Future Application**: Tool development should be evaluated as part of task processes, with clear criteria for when automation enhances rather than replaces proven manual processes.

### Interactive Knowledge Gap Resolution Insights

**Key Learning**: User input on knowledge gap resolution priorities significantly shaped coordination framework approach, particularly the emphasis on process-based validation over real-time tooling.

**Implementation Insight**: Parallel development with preliminary guidelines proves more effective than waiting for perfect specifications, enabling velocity while maintaining quality through refinement.

**Future Application**: Knowledge gaps should be treated as coordination opportunities rather than blocking issues, with resolution through real-world implementation experience.

### Strategic Direction Evolution Integration Insights

**Key Learning**: Strategic direction changes from preserved knowledge require careful integration into coordination framework to maintain architectural coherence while enabling practical implementation.

**Implementation Insight**: Build-time optimization, mathematical flexibility refinement, AI collaboration scope focus, and living documentation patterns all require coordination framework integration to be effective.

**Future Application**: Strategic direction evolution should be continuously integrated into coordination framework development rather than treated as separate concerns.

### System Relationship Mapping Insights

**Key Learning**: System relationships are most effectively coordinated through clear dependency chains (F1 → F3 → F2) and integration points rather than complex interdependency matrices.

**Implementation Insight**: Foundation systems (F1, F3, F2) enable all other systems through clear coordination patterns, while quality systems (Q1, Q2, Q3) integrate across all systems through established protocols.

**Future Application**: System coordination should focus on clear dependency chains and integration points rather than attempting to coordinate all systems simultaneously.

### Coordination Framework Architecture Insights

**Key Learning**: Coordination framework effectiveness depends on balancing process-based validation with tool development opportunities, parallel development with quality assurance, and skepticism protocols with collaboration efficiency.

**Implementation Insight**: The framework must be living and evolving, with built-in mechanisms for refinement based on real-world application and user feedback.

**Future Application**: Coordination frameworks should be designed for evolution and improvement rather than static implementation, with clear criteria for framework refinement and tool development integration.
