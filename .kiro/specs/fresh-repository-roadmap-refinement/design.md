# Fresh Repository Roadmap Refinement - Design

**Date**: January 9, 2025  
**Purpose**: Strategic framework for fresh repository implementation integrating preserved architectural knowledge  
**Approach**: North star vision with high-level supporting systems identification and strategic coordination

---

## Overview

This design establishes the strategic foundation for fresh repository development by defining a clear north star vision and identifying the high-level supporting systems needed to achieve that vision. The framework integrates preserved architectural concepts (True Native Architecture, Token Architecture 2.0, AI Collaboration Framework) with sustainable development practices learned from the contamination crisis.

The design focuses on strategic understanding rather than tactical implementation, providing the foundation for future detailed specifications while maintaining architectural coherence and contamination prevention.

## Architecture

### Strategic Framework Structure

The strategic framework consists of five interconnected components:

1. **North Star Vision**: Ultimate success definition integrating all preserved knowledge
2. **High-Level Supporting Systems**: Major architectural components needed to achieve the vision
3. **Strategic Prioritization**: Dependencies and sequencing for maximum effectiveness
4. **Knowledge Gaps and Questions**: Open questions requiring resolution
5. **Coordination Framework**: How systems work together strategically

### Integration Approach

The framework integrates preserved knowledge through three foundational pillars:

- **True Native Architecture**: Build-time platform separation with unified API contracts
- **Token Architecture 2.0**: Mathematical foundation with strategic flexibility
- **AI Collaboration Framework**: Systematic skepticism and bias mitigation

These pillars inform both the north star vision and the identification of supporting systems, ensuring architectural consistency throughout the strategic framework.

## Data Models

### North Star Vision Model

```
North Star Vision:
- Vision Statement: Clear success definition
- Success Criteria: Measurable outcomes using "customer needs + brand goals" framework
- Architectural Pillars: True Native, Token 2.0, AI Collaboration integration
- Sustainability Principles: Contamination prevention and over-engineering avoidance
- Developer Experience Goals: Rapid, confident development capabilities
```

### Supporting System Model

```
Supporting System:
- System Name: High-level system identifier
- Purpose: Strategic role in achieving north star vision
- Category: Foundation/Development/Collaboration/Quality classification
- Dependencies: Other systems this system requires
- Dependents: Other systems that require this system
- Priority Level: Foundational/Early/Standard/Later classification
```

### Knowledge Gap Model

```
Knowledge Gap:
- Question: Specific uncertainty requiring resolution
- Category: Preserved knowledge/Cross-platform/AI collaboration/Sustainable development
- Priority: Must resolve before proceeding/Can resolve during implementation
- Impact: Effect on supporting system development
- Resolution Approach: Research/Validation/Experimentation strategy
```

### Coordination Relationship Model

```
Coordination Relationship:
- System A: First system in relationship
- System B: Second system in relationship
- Relationship Type: Dependency/Integration/Coordination
- Strategic Impact: Effect on overall vision achievement

## Error Handling

### Strategic Uncertainty Management

**Approach**: Document uncertainties explicitly rather than making assumptions

**Uncertainty Categories**:
- **Known Unknowns**: Questions we've identified that need answers
- **Assumption Dependencies**: Decisions based on assumptions requiring validation
- **Implementation Risks**: Potential issues in translating strategy to tactics

**Resolution Strategy**: Prioritize uncertainties by impact on foundational systems and address through targeted research or experimentation

### Scope Creep Prevention

**Approach**: Maintain strategic focus through clear boundaries

**Prevention Mechanisms**:
- Strategic vs. tactical decision criteria
- "High-level systems" definition and examples
- Regular scope validation against north star vision
- Completion documentation capturing scope decisions

**Escalation Path**: When tactical details emerge, document for future specs rather than expanding current scope

### Architectural Coherence Maintenance

**Approach**: Ensure supporting systems align with preserved architectural principles

**Coherence Mechanisms**:
- Architectural pillar integration requirements
- Cross-system relationship validation
- Contamination prevention criteria
- Sustainable development practice integration

**Validation Strategy**: Regular coherence checks against True Native Architecture, Token Architecture 2.0, and AI Collaboration Framework principles
