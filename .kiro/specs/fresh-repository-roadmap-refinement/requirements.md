# Fresh Repository Roadmap Refinement - Requirements

**Date**: September 9, 2025  
**Purpose**: Develop a refined implementation roadmap that integrates preserved architectural knowledge with practical methodology insights  
**Approach**: Four-phase specification lifecycle methodology (Requirements → Design → Tasks → Completion) applied to strategic planning

---

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to establish strategic direction for the fresh repository implementation. Rather than attempting to plan all implementation details, this spec focuses on defining the north star vision and identifying the supporting systems needed to achieve that vision.

The deliverable is strategic understanding: what success looks like, what supporting systems we'll need, what questions need answers, and how to prioritize and sequence the work. This provides the foundation for future specs that will define specific features and systems in detail.

This spec applies the preserved four-phase specification lifecycle methodology to create strategic clarity without tactical overwhelm.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: North Star Vision Definition

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want a clear north star vision that articulates what success looks like, so that all subsequent planning and implementation decisions can align with this ultimate goal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining the vision THEN it SHALL integrate True Native Architecture, Token Architecture 2.0, and AI Collaboration Framework as foundational elements
2. WHEN articulating success THEN it SHALL use "customer needs + brand goals" decision framework rather than technical metrics
3. WHEN describing outcomes THEN it SHALL focus on sustainable design system capabilities rather than specific implementations
4. IF vision elements conflict THEN it SHALL provide clear prioritization criteria for resolution
5. WHEN communicating vision THEN it SHALL be actionable enough to guide spec creation and modular enough to support iterative implementation

### Requirement 2: Supporting Systems Identification

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want to understand what high-level supporting features and systems are necessary to achieve the north star vision, so that we can plan future development efforts strategically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the north star vision THEN it SHALL identify what supporting systems are required to achieve that vision
2. WHEN defining supporting systems THEN it SHALL describe their purpose and role without specifying implementation details
3. WHEN evaluating systems THEN it SHALL determine which are foundational vs. dependent on other systems
4. IF systems have dependencies THEN it SHALL identify those relationships for sequencing purposes
5. WHEN cataloging systems THEN it SHALL focus on strategic understanding rather than tactical specification

### Requirement 3: Strategic Prioritization and Dependencies

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to understand the priority and dependencies of supporting systems, so that future development can be sequenced for maximum effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prioritizing systems THEN it SHALL identify which are foundational and which depend on other systems
2. WHEN assessing priority THEN it SHALL apply "customer needs + brand goals" decision framework
3. WHEN identifying dependencies THEN it SHALL map relationships between systems without detailed implementation planning
4. IF systems can be developed in parallel THEN it SHALL identify those opportunities
5. WHEN establishing sequence THEN it SHALL ensure foundational systems are identified for early development

### Requirement 4: Clarifying Questions and Knowledge Gaps

**User Story:** As a planning stakeholder, I want to identify what questions need answers and what knowledge gaps exist, so that we can address uncertainties before detailed planning begins.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the north star vision THEN it SHALL identify open questions that need resolution
2. WHEN reviewing preserved knowledge THEN it SHALL identify gaps between concepts and practical application
3. WHEN assessing supporting systems THEN it SHALL identify what we don't yet understand about their requirements
4. IF assumptions are being made THEN it SHALL document them explicitly for future validation
5. WHEN cataloging questions THEN it SHALL prioritize which need answers before proceeding vs. which can be resolved during implementation

### Requirement 5: Strategic Coordination Framework

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to understand how supporting systems will coordinate together, so that future development efforts can work toward a coherent whole.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying supporting systems THEN it SHALL describe how they relate to each other at a strategic level
2. WHEN mapping relationships THEN it SHALL identify key integration points without detailed interface design
3. WHEN planning coordination THEN it SHALL ensure individual system development can contribute to the overall vision
4. IF systems have critical interdependencies THEN it SHALL identify those relationships for planning purposes
5. WHEN establishing coordination THEN it SHALL focus on strategic alignment rather than tactical implementation

## Success Criteria

- Clear north star vision that integrates preserved knowledge into strategic direction
- Supporting systems identified with purpose, priority, and dependencies understood
- Clarifying questions cataloged and prioritized for resolution
- Strategic coordination framework established for future development efforts
- Foundation established for creating detailed specs for individual systems

---

## Constraints

- Focus on strategic understanding, not tactical planning or implementation details
- No detailed spec creation for supporting systems (that's for future specs)
- No rigid timelines that create pressure to compromise quality
- No numerical quality scoring systems or health dashboards
- Must align with "customer needs + brand goals" decision framework
- Must support "getting it right over getting it right now" philosophy
- Must establish foundation for future detailed planning without doing that planning now
