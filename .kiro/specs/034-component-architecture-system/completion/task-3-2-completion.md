### Requirements Validation

**R5 - Component Quick Reference System**:
- R5.1: ✅ Routing table mapping all 11 component families to MCP document paths
- R5.2: ✅ Each family includes family name, shared need/purpose, and MCP document path

**R10 - Structural Foundation for All Component Families**:
- R10.1: ✅ All 11 families included (Buttons, Form Inputs, Containers, Icons, Modals, Avatars, Badges & Tags, Data Displays, Dividers, Loading, Navigation)
- R10.3: ✅ Component Quick Reference includes routing paths for all families regardless of implementation status

## Table Format Consistency

The routing table uses a consistent 4-column markdown format:
1. **Component Family**: Family name
2. **Shared Need/Purpose**: Brief description of what the family addresses
3. **MCP Document Path**: Path to the family's MCP documentation
4. **Status**: Readiness indicator (🟢 Production | 🟡 Beta | 🔴 Placeholder | ⚠️ Deprecated)

## Artifact Location

- **Component Quick Reference**: `.kiro/steering/Component Quick Reference.md`
- **Routing Table Section**: "Component Documentation Map"
