# Task 1.1 Completion: Create Stemma System Principles Document

**Date**: 2026-01-01
**Task**: 1.1 Create Stemma System principles document
**Type**: Architecture
**Status**: Complete
**Organization**: spec-completion
**Scope**: 034-component-architecture-system

---

## Summary

Created the comprehensive Stemma System principles document at `.kiro/steering/stemma-system-principles.md` that establishes foundational principles and governance for systematic component development across web, iOS, and Android platforms.

## Artifacts Created

| Artifact | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Stemma System Principles | `.kiro/steering/stemma-system-principles.md` | Foundational principles and governance document |

## Requirements Addressed

**Requirement R1**: Stemma System Foundation
- ✅ Defined family inheritance patterns (Principle 1)
- ✅ Documented behavioral contracts (Principle 2)
- ✅ Established composition relationships (Principle 3)
- ✅ Documented cross-platform consistency (Principle 4)
- ✅ Created governance guidelines for component development

## Document Structure

The Stemma System principles document includes:

1. **Overview**: Rosetta + Stemma integration explanation
2. **Core Principles**:
   - Principle 1: Family Inheritance Patterns
   - Principle 2: Behavioral Contracts
   - Principle 3: Composition Relationships
   - Principle 4: Cross-Platform Consistency
3. **Component Family Architecture**: All 11 families with inheritance structures
4. **Governance Guidelines**:
   - Family creation governance
   - Component addition governance
   - Contract modification governance
   - Naming convention governance
   - Readiness status governance
5. **Component Schema Format**: YAML schema structure with examples
6. **Primitive vs Semantic Usage Philosophy**: Decision framework
7. **Composition Patterns**: Login Form and Feed Post examples
8. **Cross-Platform Implementation Guidelines**: Platform-specific considerations
9. **Integration with Existing Systems**: Rosetta and token system integration
10. **Architectural Diagram**: Visual representation of the complete system

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Four Core Principles**: Organized around inheritance, contracts, composition, and consistency
2. **YAML Schema Format**: Chosen for readability and tooling compatibility
3. **Governance Checkpoints**: Human-AI checkpoints for high-impact changes
4. **Primitive Usage Philosophy**: Explicitly different from token philosophy (primitives are legitimate for coverage gaps)

## Validation (Tier 3 - Comprehensive)

- [x] Document follows steering document metadata format
- [x] All four core principles defined with rules and examples
- [x] Governance guidelines established for all component development scenarios
- [x] Component schema format documented with complete examples
- [x] Cross-platform consistency model documented
- [x] Integration with Rosetta System explained
- [x] Architectural diagram included
- [x] Related documentation cross-referenced

## Next Steps

This subtask is part of parent Task 1 (Establish Stemma System Foundation). Remaining subtasks:
- Task 1.2: Document AI-optimal naming convention
- Task 1.3: Establish component schema format
- Task 1.4: Define readiness status system
- Task 1.5: Document primitive vs semantic usage philosophy

*Task 1.1 establishes the foundational principles that all subsequent Stemma System work builds upon.*
