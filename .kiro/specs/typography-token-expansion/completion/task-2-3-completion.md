# Task 2.3 Completion: Document Inline Emphasis Patterns

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Task**: 2.3 Document inline emphasis patterns
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/specs/typography-token-expansion/inline-emphasis-guide.md` - Comprehensive guide for applying bold and italic emphasis using platform-native patterns

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Created a comprehensive guide that documents platform-native modifier patterns for applying bold and italic emphasis within text. The guide emphasizes using semantic markup and platform conventions rather than creating emphasis typography tokens, which would harm accessibility and violate compositional architecture principles.

The documentation is organized into clear sections covering:
1. Why emphasis tokens aren't needed
2. Platform-specific patterns (Web, iOS, Android)
3. Discouraged patterns with clear explanations
4. Accessibility considerations
5. Design system integration guidance

### Key Decisions

**Decision 1**: Emphasize semantic markup over custom classes
- **Rationale**: Semantic HTML (`<strong>`, `<em>`) provides accessibility benefits that custom classes cannot match. Screen readers understand semantic elements and announce them appropriately, while non-semantic markup is treated as normal text.
- **Alternative**: Could have documented custom CSS classes, but this would encourage non-semantic patterns that harm accessibility.

**Decision 2**: Provide platform-specific examples for all three platforms
- **Rationale**: Each platform has its own conventions and APIs for inline emphasis. Web uses semantic HTML, iOS uses SwiftUI modifiers, and Android uses AnnotatedString with SpanStyle. Developers need concrete examples for their specific platform.
- **Alternative**: Could have provided generic guidance, but platform-specific examples are more actionable and demonstrate the correct patterns clearly.

**Decision 3**: Include "Discouraged Patterns" section
- **Rationale**: Explicitly showing what NOT to do helps prevent common mistakes. Many developers might be tempted to use primitive fontWeight tokens directly or create custom emphasis classes, so documenting why these patterns are problematic is valuable.
- **Alternative**: Could have only shown correct patterns, but explicitly calling out anti-patterns helps developers avoid common pitfalls.

**Decision 4**: Document accessibility considerations
- **Rationale**: Accessibility is a core principle of the design system. Explaining how semantic markup supports screen readers and meets WCAG criteria reinforces why platform-native patterns are the right approach.
- **Alternative**: Could have omitted accessibility details, but this would miss an opportunity to educate developers on why these patterns matter.

### Integration Points

The inline emphasis guide integrates with:
- **Typography tokens**: Shows how to combine typography tokens with platform-native emphasis modifiers
- **Compositional architecture**: Reinforces the principle that typography defines structure while emphasis is applied separately
- **Accessibility standards**: Aligns with WCAG 2.1 success criteria for semantic markup
- **Platform conventions**: Follows established patterns for web (HTML), iOS (SwiftUI), and Android (Compose)

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ Markdown syntax correct throughout document
✅ Code examples use proper syntax for each platform (HTML, Swift, Kotlin)
✅ All formatting and structure valid

### Functional Validation
✅ Platform-native patterns documented for bold emphasis (web, iOS, Android)
✅ Platform-native patterns documented for italic emphasis (web, iOS, Android)
✅ Combined emphasis patterns documented for all platforms
✅ Discouraged patterns clearly identified with explanations
✅ Accessibility considerations thoroughly explained

### Integration Validation
✅ Integrates with typography token system (shows how to combine tokens with emphasis)
✅ Aligns with compositional architecture principles
✅ Follows design system conventions and terminology
✅ References WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards appropriately

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 6.1: Platform-native modifier patterns documented for bold and italic
✅ Requirement 6.2: Examples provided for web (semantic HTML `<strong>`, `<em>`), iOS (SwiftUI `.fontWeight(.bold)`, `.italic()`), and Android (Compose AnnotatedString with SpanStyle)
✅ Requirement 6.3: Explained why emphasis tokens aren't needed - platform modifiers handle inline styling without creating token explosion or harming accessibility
✅ Requirement 6.4: Discouraged direct use of primitive fontWeight tokens with clear rationale about accessibility and maintainability
✅ Requirement 6.5: Documented how semantic markup prevents accessibility harm that would result from non-semantic emphasis tokens

## Requirements Compliance

### Requirement 6.1: Platform-Native Modifier Patterns
Documented platform-native patterns for bold and italic emphasis across all three platforms:
- **Web**: Semantic HTML elements (`<strong>`, `<em>`)
- **iOS**: SwiftUI view modifiers (`.fontWeight(.bold)`, `.italic()`)
- **Android**: Compose AnnotatedString with SpanStyle

### Requirement 6.2: Platform-Specific Examples
Provided comprehensive code examples for each platform:
- **Web**: HTML examples with semantic elements, CSS styling, and anti-patterns
- **iOS**: SwiftUI text concatenation, AttributedString examples, and VoiceOver considerations
- **Android**: AnnotatedString with SpanStyle, XML string resources, and TalkBack support

### Requirement 6.3: Why Emphasis Tokens Aren't Needed
Explained that emphasis tokens would:
- Encourage non-semantic markup that harms accessibility
- Create token explosion (bold/italic/boldItalic for every size)
- Violate compositional architecture (emphasis is a modifier, not base style)
- Fight platform conventions that developers expect

Platform-native modifiers handle inline emphasis without these problems.

### Requirement 6.4: Discourage Direct Primitive Token Usage
Created "Discouraged Patterns" section that explicitly shows why using primitive fontWeight tokens directly is wrong:
- Bypasses semantic markup
- Harms accessibility (screen readers don't understand arbitrary font weights)
- Violates compositional architecture
- Makes code harder to maintain

Provided correct alternatives using semantic markup and platform conventions.

### Requirement 6.5: Accessibility Harm Prevention
Documented how semantic markup prevents accessibility harm:
- Screen readers announce `<strong>` and `<em>` with appropriate emphasis
- Non-semantic markup is treated as normal text by assistive technologies
- Semantic elements support WCAG 2.1 success criteria (1.3.1, 4.1.2, 1.4.8)
- Platform-native patterns ensure accessibility features work automatically
