# Task 2.1 Completion: Create Migration Guide

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Task**: 2.1 Create migration guide
**Type**: Implementation
**Organization**: spec-completion
**Scope**: typography-token-expansion
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/specs/typography-token-expansion/migration-guide.md` - Comprehensive migration guide for typography token naming changes

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Created a comprehensive migration guide that provides developers with all the information needed to migrate from old typography token names to the new consistent naming system. The guide is structured to be practical and actionable, with clear examples for each platform (web, iOS, Android).

The guide follows a progressive disclosure pattern:
1. **Overview** - Quick context on why changes were made
2. **Quick Reference Table** - Fast lookup for token name mappings
3. **Platform-Specific Examples** - Detailed before/after code for each platform
4. **Migration Strategy** - Step-by-step process for performing the migration
5. **Common Issues** - Troubleshooting guide for typical problems

### Key Decisions

**Decision 1**: Include platform-specific examples for all three platforms
- **Rationale**: Developers work in different environments and need examples relevant to their platform. Showing web, iOS, and Android examples ensures everyone can find applicable guidance.
- **Alternative**: Could have provided generic examples, but platform-specific syntax differences (CSS vs SwiftUI vs Compose) make concrete examples more valuable.

**Decision 2**: Provide both manual and automated migration approaches
- **Rationale**: Small codebases can use manual search-and-replace, while large codebases benefit from automated scripts. Offering both approaches accommodates different team sizes and preferences.
- **Alternative**: Could have only provided manual approach, but automation significantly reduces migration effort for large projects.

**Decision 3**: Include backward compatibility section with deprecation timeline
- **Rationale**: Teams need time to migrate, especially in large codebases. A clear deprecation timeline and temporary alias pattern helps teams plan their migration without breaking existing code.
- **Alternative**: Could have recommended immediate migration, but that's unrealistic for production systems with extensive token usage.

**Decision 4**: Document common migration issues proactively
- **Rationale**: Anticipating problems like partial string matches and CSS custom property naming prevents developers from encountering these issues during migration. Proactive documentation reduces support burden.
- **Alternative**: Could have waited for issues to emerge, but documenting known pitfalls upfront saves time and frustration.

### Integration Points

The migration guide integrates with:
- **Requirements Document**: References Requirement 1.5 (migration guidance)
- **Design Document**: Aligns with token naming migration map
- **Implementation**: Provides practical guidance for using renamed tokens in code

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ Markdown formatting correct
✅ Code examples properly formatted

### Functional Validation
✅ Migration table includes all 4 renamed tokens (bodySmall, body, bodyLarge, button)
✅ Search-and-replace patterns provided for each platform
✅ Before/after code examples show correct token usage
✅ Rationale for naming changes clearly explained (consistency with size scale)

### Integration Validation
✅ References requirements document correctly
✅ Aligns with design document token specifications
✅ Provides actionable guidance for all three platforms (web, iOS, Android)
✅ Includes verification checklist for post-migration validation

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 1.5: Migration guidance provided with old→new token mappings
  - Quick reference table shows all 4 token name changes
  - Platform-specific search-and-replace patterns documented
  - Rationale explained (consistency with size scale: Xs, Sm, Md, Lg)
  - Before/after code examples provided for web, iOS, and Android

## Requirements Compliance

**Requirement 1.5**: "WHEN token renames are documented, THE system SHALL provide migration guidance showing old names mapped to new names"

The migration guide fully addresses this requirement by providing:

1. **Quick Reference Table**: Clear mapping of old token names to new names with size and notes
2. **Search-and-Replace Patterns**: Platform-specific patterns for web, iOS, and Android
3. **Rationale**: Explanation that naming changes establish consistency with size scale (Xs, Sm, Md, Lg)
4. **Before/After Examples**: Concrete code examples showing token usage before and after migration for:
   - Web (CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, React)
   - iOS (SwiftUI, UIKit)
   - Android (Jetpack Compose, Android Views)
5. **Migration Strategy**: Step-by-step process for performing the migration
6. **Automated Script**: Bash script for automated migration in large codebases
7. **Common Issues**: Troubleshooting guide for typical migration problems

The guide goes beyond the minimum requirement by also providing:
- Backward compatibility guidance with deprecation timeline
- Temporary alias pattern for gradual migration
- Verification checklist for post-migration validation
- Support and questions section

*This migration guide ensures developers can smoothly transition to the new typography token naming system with clear, actionable guidance for all platforms.*
