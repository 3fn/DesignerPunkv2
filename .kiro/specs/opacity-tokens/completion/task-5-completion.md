## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/specs/opacity-tokens/safe-combinations-guide.md` - Comprehensive WCAG-compliant opacity + color combination guide
- `.kiro/specs/opacity-tokens/usage-examples.md` - Practical usage examples and AI agent guidance

## Overview

Task 5 completed the documentation phase of the opacity token system by creating comprehensive guides for safe opacity + color combinations and practical usage examples. This parent task encompassed three subtasks that together provide complete guidance for developers and AI agents working with opacity tokens.

The documentation ensures WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, provides clear examples for common use cases, explains the relationship to shadow/glow opacity systems, and includes specific AI agent guidance for token selection.

---

## Success Criteria Verification

### Criterion 1: Safe opacity + color combinations documented with WCAG guidance

**Evidence**: Safe Combinations Guide provides comprehensive WCAG 2.1 AA compliance guidance

**Verification**:
- ✅ Text opacity combinations documented with 4.5:1 contrast requirement
- ✅ Background opacity combinations documented for modal overlays, glassmorphism, and solid backgrounds
- ✅ Button state opacity examples provided with contrast validation
- ✅ Unsafe combinations documented with alternatives
- ✅ Validation workflow provided with step-by-step guidance
- ✅ Platform-specific considerations included for web, iOS, and Android

**Example from Safe Combinations Guide**:
```markdown
### Safe Text Combinations

#### Dark Text on Light Background

**✅ SAFE - Full Opacity (Maintains Contrast)**
text: { color: gray900, opacity: opacity1300 }
background: white100
Contrast: 16.1:1 ✅ (Exceeds 4.5:1 requirement)

**❌ UNSAFE - Reduced Opacity (Fails Contrast)**
text: { color: gray900, opacity: opacity600 }
background: white100
Contrast: ~2.8:1 ❌ (Fails 4.5:1 requirement)
Alternative: Use explicit gray600 color token instead
```

**Documentation Sections**:
- Text Opacity Combinations (WCAG requirements, safe/unsafe examples)
- Background Opacity Combinations (modal overlays, glassmorphism, solid backgrounds)
- Button State Opacity Examples (default, hover, pressed, disabled states)
- Unsafe Combinations with Alternatives (explicit guidance on what to avoid)
- Validation Workflow (5-step process for ensuring compliance)
- Platform-Specific Considerations (web, iOS, Android implementations)

### Criterion 2: Examples provided for common use cases

**Evidence**: Usage Examples Guide provides practical implementations for modal overlays, disabled states, and glassmorphism

**Verification**:
- ✅ Modal overlay examples with web, iOS, and Android implementations
- ✅ Disabled state examples across all platforms
- ✅ Glassmorphism effect examples with backdrop blur
- ✅ Composition patterns documented (single opacity, layered opacity, gradient opacity)
- ✅ Platform-specific code examples for each use case
- ✅ Accessibility notes included for each example

**Example from Usage Examples Guide**:
```markdown
### Example 1: Modal Overlays

**Token Selection**: `opacityOverlay` (opacity400 = 32%)

#### Web Implementation
.modal-backdrop {
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.32); /* black at opacity400 */
}

#### iOS Implementation
Color.black.opacity(0.32) // opacityOverlay

#### Android Implementation
Color.Black.copy(alpha = 0.32f) // opacityOverlay
```

**Use Cases Covered**:
- Modal Overlays (backdrop implementation across platforms)
- Disabled States (buttons, inputs, text with consistent 48% opacity)
- Glassmorphism Effects (semi-transparent surfaces with blur)
- Composition Patterns (single, layered, gradient opacity applications)

### Criterion 3: Relationship to shadow/glow opacity clearly explained

**Evidence**: Safe Combinations Guide includes comprehensive section explaining three distinct opacity systems

**Verification**:
- ✅ General opacity tokens explained (UI element transparency)
- ✅ Shadow opacity tokens explained (specialized for shadow effects)
- ✅ Glow opacity tokens explained (specialized for multi-layer glow effects)
- ✅ Decision framework provided (which system to use when)
- ✅ Common mistakes documented (using wrong opacity system)
- ✅ Cross-reference summary provided

**Example from Safe Combinations Guide**:
```markdown
### Decision Framework: Which Opacity System to Use?

**UI Element (button, card, overlay, background)**
→ Use **General Opacity Tokens**

**Shadow Effect (drop shadow, elevation shadow)**
→ Use **Shadow Opacity Tokens**

**Glow Effect (neon glow, emphasis glow, radial glow)**
→ Use **Glow Opacity Tokens**
```

**Key Distinctions Explained**:
- **General Opacity**: Linear 8% increments for UI transparency (opacity000-opacity1300)
- **Shadow Opacity**: Quality-based values for shadow effects (hard/moderate/soft)
- **Glow Opacity**: Layer-based progression for multi-layer radial effects (inner to outer)

**Why Separate Systems**:
- Design intent communication (disabled state vs shadow quality vs glow layer)
- Contextual optimization (each system optimized for specific use case)
- Mathematical relationships (different progression patterns for different purposes)
- Maintainability (clear separation prevents token misuse)

### Criterion 4: AI agent guidance included for token selection

**Evidence**: Usage Examples Guide includes comprehensive AI agent decision framework and guidance

**Verification**:
- ✅ Decision framework with step-by-step logic
- ✅ Common AI agent mistakes documented with corrections
- ✅ AI agent decision tree provided
- ✅ Validation checklist for AI agents
- ✅ Quick reference tables for semantic tokens and patterns
- ✅ Specific guidance for each use case category

**Example from Usage Examples Guide**:
```markdown
### AI Agent Decision Tree

Is this for text content?
├─ YES → Use explicit color token (not opacity)
└─ NO → Continue

Is this a disabled state?
├─ YES → Use opacityDisabled (48%)
└─ NO → Continue

Is this an interactive state?
├─ Subtle (hover) → Use opacityHover (8%)
├─ Noticeable (pressed) → Use opacityPressed (16%)
└─ Strong → Use opacity300-opacity500 (24%-40%)
```

**AI Agent Guidance Sections**:
- Decision Framework (4-step process for token selection)
- Common Mistakes to Avoid (4 documented anti-patterns with corrections)
- AI Agent Decision Tree (visual decision flow)
- Validation Checklist (7-point verification before finalizing selection)
- Quick Reference (semantic tokens, common patterns, accessibility guidelines)

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Two-Document Structure

**Options Considered**:
1. Single comprehensive guide (all content in one document)
2. Two-document structure (safe combinations + usage examples)
3. Three-document structure (safe combinations + usage examples + AI guidance)

**Decision**: Two-document structure

**Rationale**:
The two-document structure provides optimal organization by separating WCAG compliance guidance (safe combinations) from practical implementation guidance (usage examples). This separation allows developers to focus on accessibility validation separately from implementation details, while AI agents can reference both documents for comprehensive guidance.

A single document would be too long and difficult to navigate. A three-document structure would create unnecessary fragmentation, as AI guidance naturally fits within the usage examples document.

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Clear separation of concerns, easier navigation, focused content
- ❌ **Lost**: Some duplication of examples between documents
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Developers might miss one document if not properly cross-referenced

**Counter-Arguments**:
- **Argument**: Single document would be simpler to maintain
- **Response**: Two documents provide better organization and discoverability. Cross-references ensure developers find both documents.

### Decision 2: Comprehensive Shadow/Glow Relationship Section

**Options Considered**:
1. Brief mention of shadow/glow opacity (1-2 paragraphs)
2. Comprehensive section explaining all three systems
3. Separate document for opacity system relationships

**Decision**: Comprehensive section within Safe Combinations Guide

**Rationale**:
Developers and AI agents need to understand the distinction between general, shadow, and glow opacity to avoid misusing tokens. A brief mention would be insufficient for preventing common mistakes. A separate document would fragment the documentation unnecessarily.

The comprehensive section provides decision framework, common mistakes, and cross-references that enable confident token selection across all three systems.

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Complete understanding of opacity system relationships, prevention of common mistakes
- ❌ **Lost**: Some document length (but justified by importance)
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Developers might skip this section if it's too long

**Counter-Arguments**:
- **Argument**: This adds complexity to the safe combinations guide
- **Response**: Understanding system relationships is critical for safe token usage. The section is well-organized and skippable for developers who only need WCAG guidance.

### Decision 3: AI Agent Decision Framework

**Options Considered**:
1. General guidance for AI agents (descriptive text)
2. Decision tree with step-by-step logic
3. Rule-based system with if-then statements

**Decision**: Decision tree with step-by-step logic

**Rationale**:
AI agents benefit from systematic, structured decision-making processes. A decision tree provides clear branching logic that AI agents can follow reliably. General guidance would be too ambiguous, while a rule-based system would be too rigid for the nuanced decisions required in opacity token selection.

The decision tree format also helps human developers understand the decision-making process, making it valuable for both audiences.

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Systematic decision-making, clear logic flow, reliable AI agent behavior
- ❌ **Lost**: Some flexibility in decision-making (but appropriate for token selection)
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Decision tree might not cover all edge cases

**Counter-Arguments**:
- **Argument**: Decision tree is too prescriptive and limits creativity
- **Response**: Token selection should be systematic and consistent, not creative. The decision tree ensures reliable, accessible outcomes.
