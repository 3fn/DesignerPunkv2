**Date**: December 15, 2025
**Task**: 2.4 Update Layer 2 documents (Frameworks and Patterns)
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Modified

- `.kiro/steering/Development Workflow.md` - Added layer context to AI Agent Reading Priorities
- `.kiro/steering/File Organization Standards.md` - Added layer context to AI Agent Reading Priorities
- `.kiro/steering/Spec Planning Standards.md` - Added layer context to AI Agent Reading Priorities
- `.kiro/steering/Task-Type-Definitions.md` - Added comprehensive AI Agent Reading Priorities section and layer context

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Updated all four Layer 2 documents to ensure they:
1. Have comprehensive "AI Agent Reading Priorities" sections that guide strategic reading
2. Include layer context explaining their role in the progressive disclosure structure
3. Maintain accurate cross-references to other layer documents
4. Focus on providing reusable frameworks and patterns

### Key Updates

**Task-Type-Definitions.md** (Major Update):
- Added comprehensive "AI Agent Reading Priorities" section with strategic reading guidance
- Included conditional reading patterns for different spec phases
- Added layer context explaining its role as a reusable classification framework
- Maintained focus on providing systematic task type classification

**Development Workflow.md** (Minor Update):
- Added layer context to existing AI Agent Reading Priorities section
- Clarified that it's always loaded but contains extensive conditional sections
- Emphasized its role as a reusable task completion workflow framework

**File Organization Standards.md** (Minor Update):
- Added layer context to existing AI Agent Reading Priorities section
- Clarified that it's always loaded with conditional sections for specific scenarios
- Emphasized its role as a metadata-driven organization framework

**Spec Planning Standards.md** (Minor Update):
- Added layer context to existing AI Agent Reading Priorities section
- Clarified that it's conditionally loaded for spec creation work
- Emphasized its role as a systematic spec creation methodology

### Framework/Pattern Focus Verification

All Layer 2 documents maintain appropriate framework/pattern focus:

**Development Workflow.md**:
- ✅ Provides reusable task completion workflow
- ✅ Defines systematic git practices
- ✅ Establishes hook system usage patterns
- ✅ Contains conditional sections for specialized scenarios

**File Organization Standards.md**:
- ✅ Provides metadata-driven organization framework
- ✅ Defines reusable organization patterns
- ✅ Establishes cross-reference standards
- ✅ Contains conditional sections for specific organization scenarios

**Spec Planning Standards.md**:
- ✅ Provides systematic spec creation methodology
- ✅ Defines reusable requirements/design/tasks formats
- ✅ Establishes three-tier validation and documentation frameworks
- ✅ Contains extensive conditional sections for different spec phases

**Task-Type-Definitions.md**:
- ✅ Provides reusable task type classification framework
- ✅ Defines systematic validation and documentation tier assignment
- ✅ Establishes clear task type characteristics and examples
- ✅ Contains update history for evolving patterns

### Cross-Reference Verification

Verified all cross-references between Layer 2 documents are accurate:
- Development Workflow → Spec Planning Standards ✅
- Spec Planning Standards → Task-Type-Definitions ✅
- Core Goals (Layer 1) → Layer 2 documents ✅
- Meta-guide (Layer 0) → Layer 2 documents ✅

All references correctly identify layer assignments and document purposes.

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ All markdown files have valid syntax
✅ No broken formatting or structure issues
✅ All metadata headers are complete and accurate

### Functional Validation
✅ All Layer 2 documents have "AI Agent Reading Priorities" sections
✅ Layer context added to all documents explaining their role
✅ Strategic reading guidance is clear and actionable
✅ Framework/pattern focus is maintained in all documents

### Integration Validation
✅ Cross-references between Layer 2 documents are accurate
✅ References to Layer 1 documents are correct
✅ References from Layer 0 meta-guide are accurate
✅ Layer assignments are consistent across all references

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 2.5: Layer 2 documents provide reusable frameworks and patterns
✅ Requirement 8.1: All documents include "AI Agent Reading Priorities" sections
✅ Requirement 8.2: Reading priorities use WHEN/THEN format with clear conditions
✅ Requirement 8.4: Cross-references use consistent format and resolve correctly

## Requirements Compliance

**Requirement 2.5**: WHEN Layer 2 documents are loaded THEN the system SHALL provide reusable frameworks and patterns for common workflows
- ✅ All Layer 2 documents focus on reusable frameworks and patterns
- ✅ Development Workflow provides task completion framework
- ✅ File Organization Standards provides metadata-driven organization framework
- ✅ Spec Planning Standards provides spec creation methodology
- ✅ Task-Type-Definitions provides classification framework

**Requirement 8.1**: WHEN steering documents are created THEN the system SHALL include "AI Agent Reading Priorities" sections at the top
- ✅ All Layer 2 documents have "AI Agent Reading Priorities" sections
- ✅ Task-Type-Definitions.md now has comprehensive reading priorities
- ✅ Other documents had existing sections that were enhanced with layer context

**Requirement 8.2**: WHEN "AI Agent Reading Priorities" sections are written THEN the system SHALL use WHEN/THEN format with clear task type conditions
- ✅ All reading priorities use WHEN/THEN format
- ✅ Task type conditions are clear and specific
- ✅ Strategic reading guidance is actionable

**Requirement 8.4**: WHEN cross-references are added THEN the system SHALL use relative paths and descriptive link text
- ✅ All cross-references use relative paths
- ✅ Link text is descriptive and includes layer information
- ✅ References resolve correctly across documents

## Observations

### Task-Type-Definitions.md Enhancement

The most significant update was adding comprehensive "AI Agent Reading Priorities" to Task-Type-Definitions.md. This document previously lacked strategic reading guidance, which could lead to AI agents reading the entire document when only specific sections were relevant.

The new reading priorities section provides:
- Clear guidance for different spec phases (planning vs execution)
- Conditional reading patterns for ambiguous task classification
- Skip conditions for obvious task types
- Layer context explaining its role in the framework

### Layer Context Pattern

Adding layer context to all Layer 2 documents creates consistency and helps AI agents understand:
- Why the document is loaded (always vs conditional)
- What role it plays in the progressive disclosure structure
- How it relates to other layer documents
- When to read deeply vs skim

This pattern should be applied to Layer 3 documents as well for consistency.

### Framework Focus Maintained

All Layer 2 documents maintain strong framework/pattern focus:
- They provide reusable methodologies, not one-time instructions
- They establish systematic approaches, not ad-hoc solutions
- They contain conditional sections for specialized scenarios
- They support multiple task types through strategic reading guidance

This distinguishes them from Layer 1 (essential context) and Layer 3 (specific implementations).
