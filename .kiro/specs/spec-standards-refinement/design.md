# Design Document: Spec Standards Refinement

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Spec**: Spec Standards Refinement  
**Status**: Design Phase  
**Dependencies**: None

---

## Overview

This design document outlines the approach for refining the Spec Planning Standards to implement a three-tier system for task classification, validation, and completion documentation. The design addresses quality concerns identified through F1 vs F2 comparative analysis while maintaining reasonable token efficiency.

The core design principle is **alignment**: validation depth, documentation detail, and task complexity should all align through a consistent three-tier classification system.

## Error Handling

### Task Type Classification Errors

**Scenario**: AI agent cannot determine task type during planning

**Handling**:
1. AI agent prompts human: "This task could be classified as [Type A] or [Type B]. Which is more appropriate?"
2. Human provides classification decision
3. AI agent documents decision in tasks.md
4. If new pattern, AI agent updates Task Type Definitions document with pattern and rationale

**Example**:
```
AI: "Task 1.3: 'Implement configuration validation logic'

This could be:
- Implementation (writing validation code)
- Architecture (designing validation strategy)

Which classification is more appropriate?"

Human: "Architecture - this establishes the validation pattern for the system"

AI: "Understood. Classifying as Architecture task. This will use Tier 3: Comprehensive validation and documentation."
```

### Validation Failure Handling

**Scenario**: Validation fails at any tier

**Handling**:
1. Document specific validation failures
2. Fix errors before proceeding
3. Re-run validation
4. Document resolution in completion doc

**Example**:
```markdown
## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Initial Validation (Failed)
❌ getDiagnostics found 2 type errors in TokenSelector.ts
❌ Functional validation: selectToken() not returning correct priority

### Resolution
- Fixed type errors: Added proper type annotations
- Fixed priority logic: Corrected semantic token check

### Final Validation (Passed)
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ Functional validation: selectToken() returns correct priority
```

### Missing Task Type Metadata

**Scenario**: Task in tasks.md doesn't have Type metadata

**Handling**:
1. AI agent defaults to higher tier (safer)
2. AI agent prompts human for clarification
3. Human provides classification
4. AI agent updates tasks.md with Type metadata

---

## Testing Strategy

### Validation Testing

**Unit Testing**: Not applicable (this is process documentation)

**Integration Testing**: Apply three-tier system to next spec and measure:
- Are errors caught at appropriate times?
- Is documentation depth appropriate for task complexity?
- Is task type classification clear and consistent?
- Are token costs within expected range?

**Validation Metrics**:
- Error detection timing (immediate vs delayed)
- Completion doc coverage (should be 100% of subtasks)
- Token usage per spec (compare to F1 and F2)
- Task type classification consistency (% of tasks requiring human clarification)

### Documentation Testing

**Completeness Check**:
- All three tiers have clear definitions
- All validation checks are specific and measurable
- All completion doc sections are defined
- Task Type Definitions includes sufficient examples

**Clarity Check**:
- Can an AI agent apply the three-tier system without ambiguity?
- Can a human understand the rationale for the approach?
- Are examples clear and representative?

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Three Tiers Instead of Four

**Options Considered**:
- Four tiers: Setup, Implementation, Architecture, Parent
- Three tiers: Setup, Implementation, Architecture+Parent
- Two tiers: Simple, Complex

**Decision**: Three tiers (Setup, Implementation, Architecture+Parent)

**Rationale**:
- Simpler mental model than four tiers
- Architecture and Parent tasks both need thorough validation
- Conditional sections handle Parent-specific needs (success criteria)
- Reduces cognitive load during execution

**Trade-offs**:
- Parent tasks and Architecture tasks use same tier (less distinction)
- Requires conditional sections for Parent-specific content

**Counter-Arguments**:
- Parent tasks are fundamentally different from Architecture subtasks
- Four tiers would provide clearer distinction
- Response: Conditional sections provide sufficient distinction without additional tier complexity

### Decision 2: Task Type Classification During Planning

**Options Considered**:
- Classify during planning phase (when creating tasks.md)
- Classify during execution phase (when implementing tasks)
- No explicit classification (agent decides on the fly)

**Decision**: Classify during planning phase

**Rationale**:
- Removes ambiguity during execution
- Task type documented in tasks.md for reference
- Allows human oversight of classification decisions
- Enables consistent application across all agents

**Trade-offs**:
- Requires upfront classification effort
- Might need reclassification if task changes

**Counter-Arguments**:
- Classification during execution allows for more context
- Response: Planning phase has full context of task structure and dependencies

### Decision 3: Separate Completion Doc Per Subtask

**Options Considered**:
- One doc per parent task with all subtask notes
- Separate doc per subtask
- Inline notes in tasks.md (no separate docs)

**Decision**: Separate doc per subtask

**Rationale**:
- Clear ownership (each subtask has its own doc)
- Incremental writing (write immediately after subtask)
- Easy navigation (want subtask 1.2 info? Open task-1-2-completion.md)
- Git history (separate commits per subtask)
- Parallel work (no file conflicts)

**Trade-offs**:
- More files to manage
- Potential duplication between subtask and parent docs

**Counter-Arguments**:
- Single doc per parent task would be simpler
- Response: Separate docs provide better organization and incremental documentation

### Decision 4: Living Task Type Definitions Document

**Options Considered**:
- Static definitions in Spec Planning Standards
- Living document that can be updated
- No formal definitions (examples only)

**Decision**: Living document in .kiro/steering/

**Rationale**:
- Definitions can evolve as new patterns emerge
- Update history tracks how definitions change
- Separate document keeps Spec Planning Standards focused
- Enables collaborative refinement (human + AI)

**Trade-offs**:
- Another document to maintain
- Definitions might drift over time

**Counter-Arguments**:
- Static definitions would be simpler
- Response: Living document enables continuous improvement as we learn

### Decision 5: Validation Aligned with Task Type

**Options Considered**:
- Validate after every subtask (F1 approach)
- Validate only at parent level (F2 approach)
- Validate at fixed intervals (every 2-3 tasks)
- Validate based on task type (three-tier approach)

**Decision**: Validate based on task type (three-tier approach)

**Rationale**:
- Validation effort matches risk level
- Objective rule (task type determines validation)
- Balances quality and token efficiency
- Catches errors at appropriate times

**Trade-offs**:
- Setup tasks get minimal validation (might miss issues)
- More complex than F2 approach (parent only)

**Counter-Arguments**:
- F1 approach (validate everything) is safer
- Response: Three-tier approach provides sufficient safety at lower token cost

## Success Metrics

### Process Metrics

- **Task Type Classification Consistency**: >90% of tasks classified without human clarification needed
- **Completion Doc Coverage**: 100% of subtasks have completion docs
- **Validation Timing**: Errors caught within same task (not accumulated to parent level)

### Quality Metrics

- **Error Detection**: Errors caught at appropriate tier (syntax errors in all tiers, design errors in Tier 3)
- **Documentation Depth**: Appropriate detail for task complexity (brief for Setup, extensive for Architecture)
- **Clarity**: AI agents can apply system without ambiguity

### Efficiency Metrics

- **Token Usage**: ~14,000 tokens per spec (between F1 and F2)
- **Execution Time**: Comparable to F2 (validation adds minimal time)
- **Refinement Feeling**: Subjective assessment that execution feels "more refined" than F2
