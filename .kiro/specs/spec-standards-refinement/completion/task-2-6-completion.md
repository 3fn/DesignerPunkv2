# Task 2.6 Completion: Add Rationale Section

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Task**: 2.6 Add Rationale section
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/steering/Spec Planning Standards.md` - Added comprehensive "Rationale for Three-Tier Approach" section

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Added a comprehensive Rationale section to the Spec Planning Standards document that explains why the three-tier approach was chosen based on the F1 vs F2 audit findings. The section was strategically placed after the Task Type Classification System section and before the Three-Tier Validation System section, providing context before diving into the detailed validation specifications.

The rationale section includes:

1. **Background**: Comparison of F1 and F2 execution patterns with quantitative data
2. **Audit Findings Summary**: Table showing key metrics and quality impact assessment
3. **Why Three Tiers**: Explanation of alignment principle, objective classification, and balanced approach
4. **Token Impact Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of token usage by tier with projections
5. **Quality Improvements**: How three-tier approach addresses F2's weaknesses
6. **Decision-Making Process**: Systematic skepticism with counter-arguments and responses
7. **Expected Outcomes**: Quality, efficiency, and developer experience metrics
8. **Reference Documentation**: Link to audit summary document

### Key Decisions

**Decision 1**: Placement of Rationale section
- **Rationale**: Placed after Task Type Classification but before Three-Tier Validation to provide context for why the validation system exists
- **Alternative**: Could have placed at the end of the document, but that would separate the rationale from the systems it explains

**Decision 2**: Level of detail in token analysis
- **Rationale**: Included detailed token calculations to provide concrete evidence for the approach, not just qualitative arguments
- **Alternative**: Could have kept it high-level, but specific numbers make the trade-offs clearer

**Decision 3**: Including counter-arguments
- **Rationale**: Applied systematic skepticism by including counter-arguments and responses, demonstrating that alternatives were considered
- **Alternative**: Could have presented only the chosen approach, but counter-arguments strengthen the rationale

### Integration Points

The Rationale section integrates with:
- **Task Type Classification System**: Explains why three task types were chosen
- **Three-Tier Validation System**: Provides context for why validation depth varies by tier
- **Three-Tier Completion Documentation System**: Explains why documentation detail varies by tier
- **Audit Summary Document**: References the detailed audit for readers who want more information

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ Markdown formatting correct
✅ All section headers properly formatted

### Functional Validation
✅ Rationale section provides clear explanation of three-tier approach
✅ F1 vs F2 audit findings accurately summarized with quantitative data
✅ Token impact analysis includes specific calculations and projections
✅ Counter-arguments included demonstrating systematic skepticism
✅ Reference to audit summary document included

### Integration Validation
✅ Section flows logically from Task Type Classification to Three-Tier Validation
✅ Content aligns with audit findings in spec-execution-audit-f1-vs-f2.md
✅ Token calculations consistent with design document projections
✅ References to other sections and documents are accurate

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 5.6: Rationale section created with audit findings
✅ Created new section "Rationale for Three-Tier Approach"
✅ Summarized F1 vs F2 audit findings with quantitative table
✅ Explained why three-tier approach was chosen (alignment, objective classification, balanced approach)
✅ Included token impact analysis with detailed calculations
✅ Linked to audit summary document for complete details

## Requirements Compliance

### Requirement 5.6: Rationale in Spec Planning Standards

**Requirement**: "WHEN reading Spec Planning Standards THEN it SHALL include the rationale for the three-tier approach (audit findings)"

**Implementation**:
- ✅ Created comprehensive "Rationale for Three-Tier Approach" section
- ✅ Included background on F1 vs F2 execution patterns
- ✅ Summarized audit findings with quantitative comparison table
- ✅ Explained why three tiers (alignment principle, objective classification, balanced approach)
- ✅ Provided detailed token impact analysis with calculations
- ✅ Documented quality improvements over F2 approach
- ✅ Applied systematic skepticism with counter-arguments
- ✅ Included expected outcomes for quality, efficiency, and developer experience
- ✅ Referenced audit summary document for complete details

**Evidence**: The Rationale section provides comprehensive context for the three-tier approach, enabling readers to understand not just what the system is, but why it was designed this way and what problems it solves.

## Content Structure

### Section Organization

The Rationale section is organized into 8 major subsections:

1. **Overview**: Brief introduction to the rationale and its purpose
2. **Background: F1 vs F2 Execution Patterns**: Detailed comparison of the two approaches
3. **Audit Findings Summary**: Quantitative table and quality impact assessment
4. **Why Three Tiers?**: Explanation of alignment principle, objective classification, and balanced approach
5. **Token Impact Analysis**: Detailed token calculations by tier with projections
6. **Quality Improvements Over F2**: How three-tier addresses F2's weaknesses
7. **Decision-Making Process**: Systematic skepticism with counter-arguments
8. **Expected Outcomes**: Quality, efficiency, and developer experience metrics

### Key Content Elements

**Quantitative Data**:
- Comparison table showing F1 vs F2 metrics (completion doc coverage, validation cycles, doc length, token usage)
- Token usage calculations by tier (Tier 1: ~200, Tier 2: ~500, Tier 3: ~1,000-1,400)
- Projected token usage for typical spec (~27,500 tokens)
- Comparison showing 30% savings vs F1, quality improvement vs F2

**Qualitative Analysis**:
- F1 strengths and weaknesses
- F2 strengths and weaknesses
- Quality impact assessment (delayed error detection, reduced checkpoints, less knowledge preservation)
- User experience observations

**Decision Rationale**:
- Why three tiers instead of two or four
- Alignment principle (complexity, validation, documentation)
- Objective classification criteria
- Balanced approach explanation

**Systematic Skepticism**:
- Counter-argument 1: "F2's approach is simpler"
- Counter-argument 2: "Why not just revert to F1?"
- Counter-argument 3: "Three tiers is arbitrary"
- Responses to each counter-argument

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

**Quantitative Evidence**: Including specific numbers (token counts, percentages, metrics) makes the rationale much more compelling than qualitative arguments alone.

**Systematic Skepticism**: Including counter-arguments and responses demonstrates that alternatives were seriously considered, strengthening the rationale.

**Strategic Placement**: Placing the rationale before the detailed validation system provides context that helps readers understand why the system is designed the way it is.

### Challenges

**Balancing Detail**: Finding the right level of detail was challenging - too much and it becomes overwhelming, too little and it lacks substance. Settled on detailed token analysis with reference to audit summary for complete details.

**Avoiding Repetition**: The rationale needed to summarize audit findings without duplicating the entire audit document. Used a summary table and key findings approach with reference to full audit.

### Future Considerations

**Living Document**: As the three-tier system is applied to more specs, the rationale section should be updated with actual outcomes vs projected outcomes.

**Evidence Updates**: If token usage or quality metrics differ from projections, the rationale should be updated to reflect reality.

**New Insights**: As new patterns emerge or challenges are discovered, the rationale should evolve to address them.

## Integration Points

### Dependencies

- **spec-execution-audit-f1-vs-f2.md**: Source of quantitative data and audit findings
- **Design Document**: Source of token impact projections and three-tier system design
- **Requirements Document**: Source of requirement 5.6 that this task addresses

### Dependents

- **Three-Tier Validation System**: Benefits from context provided by rationale
- **Three-Tier Completion Documentation System**: Benefits from context provided by rationale
- **Future Spec Creators**: Will understand why the three-tier system exists and how to apply it

### Extension Points
