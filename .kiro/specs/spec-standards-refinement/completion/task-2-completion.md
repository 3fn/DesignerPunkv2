# Task 2 Completion: Update Spec Planning Standards Document

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Task**: 2. Update Spec Planning Standards Document
**Type**: Parent
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/steering/Spec Planning Standards.md` (updated with three-tier system)

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Integration Approach for Three-Tier System

**Options Considered**:
1. Replace existing Spec Planning Standards with entirely new document
2. Create separate three-tier standards document and reference from main document
3. Integrate three-tier system sections into existing document structure

**Decision**: Integrate three-tier system sections into existing document structure

**Rationale**: 
The Spec Planning Standards document already had a well-established structure covering requirements, design, and tasks formats. Rather than disrupting this proven structure, we integrated the three-tier system as new sections that complement and enhance the existing guidance.

This approach maintains continuity for users familiar with the existing standards while adding the new three-tier classification, validation, and documentation systems. The integration points are natural - the Task Type Classification System section flows logically after the Tasks Document Format section, and the validation and documentation systems provide the detailed guidance that was previously implicit.

By updating examples throughout the document to include task type metadata, we ensured consistency between the new three-tier system and the existing format specifications.

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Continuity with existing standards, natural integration, comprehensive single document
- ❌ **Lost**: Some document length increase (now ~2,380 lines)
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Document complexity might be overwhelming for new users

**Counter-Arguments**:
- **Argument**: A separate three-tier document would be cleaner and easier to maintain
- **Response**: Splitting the standards would create confusion about which document to follow and require constant cross-referencing. A unified document ensures all spec planning guidance is in one place.

### Decision 2: Section Ordering and Flow

**Options Considered**:
1. Place three-tier system sections at the beginning (before format sections)
2. Place three-tier system sections at the end (after all format sections)
3. Integrate three-tier sections logically within existing structure

**Decision**: Integrate three-tier sections logically within existing structure

**Rationale**:
The document flow now follows a natural progression:
1. Requirements, Design, and Tasks format specifications (what to create)
2. Task Type Classification System (how to categorize tasks)
3. Rationale for Three-Tier Approach (why this system exists)
4. Three-Tier Validation System (how to validate work)
5. Three-Tier Completion Documentation System (how to document completion)
6. Spec Workflow (how everything fits together)

This ordering allows readers to understand the basic formats first, then learn about the classification system, understand the rationale, and finally dive into the detailed validation and documentation requirements. The workflow section at the end ties everything together.

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Logical progression, easier learning curve, natural flow
- ❌ **Lost**: Three-tier system not immediately visible at document start
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Users might miss the three-tier sections if they only read the beginning

**Counter-Arguments**:
- **Argument**: Placing three-tier system at the beginning would emphasize its importance
- **Response**: Users need to understand the basic format specifications before they can appreciate the three-tier classification system. The current flow builds understanding progressively.

### Decision 3: Example Comprehensiveness

**Options Considered**:
1. Minimal examples showing only basic task type metadata
2. Comprehensive examples showing all three task types with full context
3. Progressive examples starting simple and building complexity

**Decision**: Comprehensive examples showing all three task types with full context

**Rationale**:
The examples section now includes five detailed examples:
1. Parent task with mixed subtask types (shows all three types together)
2. Setup task (Tier 1 - Minimal)
3. Implementation task (Tier 2 - Standard)
4. Architecture task (Tier 3 - Comprehensive)
5. Complete feature with all task types (shows real-world complexity)

These comprehensive examples provide concrete reference points for AI agents and humans creating specs. By showing full context (success criteria, artifacts, requirements references), the examples demonstrate not just the task type metadata but how it integrates with the complete task format.

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Clear reference examples, reduced ambiguity, practical guidance
- ❌ **Lost**: Example section length (adds ~200 lines to document)
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Too many examples might overwhelm rather than clarify

**Counter-Arguments**:
- **Argument**: Simpler examples would be easier to scan and understand
- **Response**: Simple examples don't show how task types work in real-world scenarios. The comprehensive examples provide the context needed for accurate application.

## Overall Integration Story

### Complete Workflow

The updated Spec Planning Standards now provides a complete workflow for creating and executing specs with the three-tier system:

1. **Requirements Phase**: Create requirements using EARS format (unchanged)
2. **Design Phase**: Create design with architecture and decisions (unchanged)
3. **Tasks Phase**: Create tasks with task type classification
   - Review task characteristics (structural vs coding vs design)
   - Assign task type (Setup, Implementation, Architecture)
   - Add Type and Validation metadata to each subtask
   - Reference Task Type Definitions for guidance
4. **Execution Phase**: Execute tasks with appropriate validation and documentation
   - Setup tasks: Tier 1 validation + Tier 1 documentation
   - Implementation tasks: Tier 2 validation + Tier 2 documentation
   - Architecture tasks: Tier 3 validation + Tier 3 documentation
   - Parent tasks: Tier 3 validation + Tier 3 documentation with success criteria

This workflow ensures consistent application of the three-tier system across all spec development.

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

- **Incremental Integration**: Adding sections one at a time allowed for careful integration with existing content
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Providing full-context examples made the three-tier system concrete and actionable
- **Evidence-Based Rationale**: Including F1 vs F2 audit data gave credibility to the three-tier approach
- **Consistent Terminology**: Using the same terms (Setup, Implementation, Architecture) across all sections reduced confusion

### Challenges

- **Document Length**: The document grew to ~2,380 lines, which might be overwhelming for new users
  - **Resolution**: Used clear section headings and progressive disclosure to make navigation easier
- **Example Comprehensiveness vs Brevity**: Balancing detailed examples with document length
  - **Resolution**: Chose comprehensive examples because they provide better guidance despite length
- **Integration Points**: Ensuring new sections flowed naturally with existing content
  - **Resolution**: Carefully considered section ordering and added transition text where needed

### Future Considerations

- **Document Splitting**: Consider splitting into multiple documents if length becomes problematic
  - Could have separate documents for validation system and documentation system
  - Would need to maintain cross-references and ensure consistency
- **Interactive Examples**: Could add interactive examples or decision trees for task classification
  - Would help users learn the classification system more quickly
  - Could be implemented as separate tooling
- **Validation Automation**: Could create tools to validate task metadata format
  - Would catch missing Type or Validation fields automatically
  - Could suggest task types based on task description

## Integration Points

### Dependencies

- **Task Type Definitions**: Spec Planning Standards references `.kiro/steering/Task-Type-Definitions.md` for detailed task type definitions and examples
- **Audit Summary**: Rationale section references `.kiro/specs/spec-standards-refinement/completion/audit-summary.md` for complete F1 vs F2 analysis
- **File Organization Standards**: Completion documentation guidance aligns with `.kiro/steering/File Organization Standards.md`
- **Development Workflow**: Spec workflow aligns with `.kiro/steering/Development Workflow.md`

### Dependents

- **Future Specs**: All future specs will follow the updated Spec Planning Standards with three-tier system
- **AI Agents**: AI agents will use the three-tier system for consistent spec execution
- **Spec Creators**: Humans creating specs will reference the updated standards for guidance
- **Validation Tools**: Future validation tools will check for task type metadata compliance

### Extension Points

- **New Task Types**: If new task patterns emerge, Task Type Definitions can be updated and referenced
- **Additional Validation Tiers**: If needed, validation system could be extended (though three tiers should be sufficient)
- **Custom Documentation Formats**: Teams could create custom documentation formats based on the three-tier templates
- **Automated Classification**: Could build tools to suggest task types based on task descriptions

### API Surface

**Spec Planning Standards Document**:
- Provides format specifications for requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md
- Defines three task types: Setup, Implementation, Architecture
- Specifies three validation tiers: Minimal, Standard, Comprehensive
- Specifies three documentation tiers: Minimal, Standard, Comprehensive
- Documents complete spec workflow from requirements through execution

**Integration with Other Standards**:
- Task Type Definitions: Detailed task type guidance
