## F1 vs F2 Comparative Analysis

This section documents the quantitative analysis of execution patterns between F1 (Mathematical Token System) and F2 (Cross-Platform Build System) that led to the development of the three-tier approach. The analysis is based on detailed audit findings documented in `spec-execution-audit-f1-vs-f2.md`.

### Quantitative Findings

#### Task Structure Comparison

| Metric | F1 (Mathematical Token System) | F2 (Cross-Platform Build System) | Change |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------|
| **Primary Tasks** | 10 | 10 | - |
| **Subtasks** | 39 | 41 | +2 |
| **Total Tasks** | 49 | 51 | +2 |
| **Completion Docs** | 37 | 28 | -9 |
| **Completion Doc Coverage** | 95% (37/39 subtasks) | 68% (28/41 subtasks) | **-27%** |

**Key Finding**: F2 has significantly fewer completion documents, with only 68% of subtasks documented compared to F1's 95% coverage.

#### Validation Frequency Comparison

| Approach | Validation Cycles | Validation Timing | Validation Scope |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **F1** | ~39 cycles | After each subtask | TypeScript + Functional + Requirements |
| **F2** | ~10 cycles | After parent task only | Syntax + Success Criteria |
| **Change** | **-75%** | Delayed validation | Restructured categories |

**Key Finding**: F2 has 75% fewer validation checkpoints, with validation occurring only at parent task completion rather than after each subtask.

#### Documentation Depth Analysis

| Metric | F1 Average | F2 Average | Change |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Lines per Completion Doc** | ~800 lines | ~400 lines | **-50%** |
| **Sections per Doc** | 8 major sections | 6 major sections | -2 |
| **Code Examples** | Extensive | Moderate | Reduced |
| **Architectural Discussion** | Comprehensive | Focused | Reduced |
| **Lessons Learned** | Extensive | Concise | Reduced |

**Key Finding**: F2 completion documents are 50% shorter with less architectural discussion, fewer code examples, and more concise lessons learned sections.

#### Token Usage Impact

| Approach | Completion Docs | Validation Cycles | Total Tokens | Savings |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|---------|
| **F1** | ~31,200 lines | ~7,800 tokens | ~39,000 tokens | Baseline |
| **F2** | ~11,200 lines | ~2,000 tokens | ~13,200 tokens | **-65%** |

**Key Finding**: F2 achieved a 65% reduction in token usage (~25,800 tokens saved) through reduced completion documentation and validation frequency.

### Quality Impact

The quantitative changes in F2's approach created several quality concerns that contributed to the "less refined" execution feeling:

#### 1. Delayed Error Detection

**F1 Pattern**: Errors caught immediately after each subtask
```
Subtask 2.1 → Validate → Error found → Fix immediately
Subtask 2.2 → Validate → Error found → Fix immediately
```

**F2 Pattern**: Errors accumulate until parent task validation
```
Subtask 1.1 → No validation
Subtask 1.2 → No validation (error introduced)
Subtask 1.3 → No validation (builds on error)
Parent Task 1 → Validate → Multiple errors found → Larger debugging session
```

**Impact**: Errors can compound across multiple subtasks, making debugging more complex and time-consuming. Issues introduced in early subtasks may not be detected until several subtasks later, making it harder to identify the root cause.

#### 2. Reduced Incremental Checkpoints

**F1 Approach**: 39 checkpoints provide frequent "save points"
- Easy to identify when something went wrong
- Smaller scope for debugging (single subtask)
- Clear progress markers throughout implementation
- Immediate feedback on implementation quality

**F2 Approach**: 10 checkpoints provide less frequent "save points"
- Harder to identify when something went wrong
- Larger scope for debugging (multiple subtasks)
- Less granular progress tracking
- Delayed feedback on implementation quality

**Impact**: The reduced checkpoint frequency makes it harder to pinpoint when issues were introduced. With 3-4 subtasks between validation points, developers must review more code to identify problems.

#### 3. Less Comprehensive Knowledge Preservation

**F1 Documentation Characteristics**:
- ~800 lines per completion document
- Detailed algorithms with code examples
- Comprehensive architectural discussion
- Extensive design decision rationale
- In-depth lessons learned sections
- Future integration considerations

**F2 Documentation Characteristics**:
- ~400 lines per completion document
- Focused on implementation and testing
- Concise architectural discussion
- Brief design decision rationale
- Shorter lessons learned sections
- Limited future considerations

**Impact**: The reduced documentation depth means less architectural knowledge is preserved for future reference. Complex design decisions and their rationale are documented less thoroughly, making it harder for future developers (or AI agents) to understand why certain approaches were chosen.

#### 4. Inconsistent Application Standards

**Standard Statement**: "One completion doc per primary task"

**Actual Practice**: Completion docs created for:
- All primary tasks (10 docs)
- Complex subtasks (~18 docs)
- Simple subtasks (0 docs)

**Ambiguity**: No clear definition of what makes a subtask "complex enough" to warrant completion documentation.

**Impact**: Inconsistent application of standards leads to subjective decisions about when to create completion docs. This ambiguity can result in important subtasks being underdocumented while less critical subtasks receive full documentation.

#### 5. Validation Timing Concerns

**F1 Validation Flow**:
```
Implement → Validate → Document → Next Task
(Immediate feedback loop)
```

**F2 Validation Flow**:
```
Implement Task 1.1 → Implement Task 1.2 → Implement Task 1.3 → Validate All → Document
(Delayed feedback loop)
```

**Impact**: The delayed validation means developers continue building on potentially flawed foundations. If Task 1.1 has an architectural issue, Tasks 1.2 and 1.3 may be built on that flawed foundation before the issue is detected.

### Evidence Supporting Quality Concerns

The quantitative data provides clear evidence for the quality concerns:

1. **Completion Doc Coverage**: 95% → 68% (-27%) indicates significant reduction in documentation checkpoints
2. **Validation Frequency**: 39 cycles → 10 cycles (-75%) indicates much less frequent quality gates
3. **Documentation Depth**: ~800 lines → ~400 lines (-50%) indicates less comprehensive knowledge preservation
4. **Error Detection Timing**: Immediate → Delayed indicates potential for error accumulation

These metrics collectively explain the "less refined" feeling - there are objectively fewer quality checkpoints, less comprehensive documentation, and delayed error detection compared to F1's approach.

## Three-Tier Approach Rationale

### Why Three Tiers Instead of Two or Four

The three-tier system was chosen after careful consideration of alternative approaches. This section explains why three tiers provides the optimal balance for task classification, validation depth, and documentation detail.

#### Alternative Approaches Considered

**Two-Tier Approach (Simple vs Complex)**:
- **Pros**: Simpler mental model, easier to classify tasks
- **Cons**: Forces binary decisions that don't match reality, no middle ground for standard implementation work
- **Problem**: Most tasks fall into a "medium complexity" category that doesn't fit either extreme

**Four-Tier Approach (Setup, Implementation, Architecture, Parent)**:
- **Pros**: More granular distinction between task types, separate tier for parent tasks
- **Cons**: Increased cognitive load during classification, diminishing returns on granularity
- **Problem**: Parent tasks and Architecture tasks both need comprehensive validation - separate tiers add complexity without proportional benefit

**Three-Tier Approach (Setup, Implementation, Architecture+Parent)**:
- **Pros**: Clear distinction between structural, coding, and design work; sufficient granularity without excessive complexity
- **Cons**: Parent tasks and Architecture tasks share the same tier (less distinction)
- **Solution**: Conditional sections handle Parent-specific needs (success criteria verification) without requiring a separate tier

#### Why Three Tiers is Optimal

**1. Natural Work Categories**

Three tiers map directly to natural categories of development work:

- **Setup (Tier 1)**: Structural work - creating directories, configuration files, installing dependencies
- **Implementation (Tier 2)**: Coding work - writing features, building functionality, implementing logic
- **Architecture (Tier 3)**: Design work - making architectural decisions, creating algorithms, establishing patterns

These categories are intuitive and align with how developers naturally think about their work.

**2. Objective Classification Criteria**

Three tiers provide clear, objective criteria for classification:

| Characteristic | Setup | Implementation | Architecture |
|----------------|-------|----------------|--------------|
| **Work Type** | Structural | Coding | Design |
| **Complexity** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Risk Level** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Logic Required** | Minimal | Moderate | Extensive |
| **Validation Needs** | Syntax + Artifacts | Syntax + Functional + Integration | Syntax + Functional + Design + System |

These objective criteria reduce ambiguity during task classification.

**3. Balanced Granularity**

Three tiers provide sufficient granularity to match validation and documentation to task complexity without creating excessive classification overhead:

- **Too Few Tiers (2)**: Forces tasks into extremes, missing the large middle ground
- **Just Right (3)**: Captures low, medium, and high complexity with clear distinctions
- **Too Many Tiers (4+)**: Adds cognitive load without proportional benefit

**4. Scalable Mental Model**

Three tiers create a simple, memorable mental model:

- **Tier 1**: Quick structural work with minimal validation
- **Tier 2**: Standard implementation with functional validation
- **Tier 3**: Complex design work with comprehensive validation

This simplicity enables consistent application across different specs and team members.

#### Parent Tasks as Tier 3 Extension

Parent tasks use Tier 3 (Comprehensive) validation and documentation with additional sections for:

- **Success Criteria Verification**: Each criterion verified with evidence
- **Overall Integration Story**: How subtasks fit together
- **Subtask Integration Validation**: Verify all subtasks work together

This approach provides the distinction needed for parent tasks without requiring a separate tier, keeping the mental model simple while addressing parent-specific needs.

### The Alignment Principle

The three-tier system is built on a fundamental principle: **validation depth, documentation detail, and task complexity should all align**.

#### The Alignment Concept

```
Task Complexity → Validation Depth → Documentation Detail
     ↓                   ↓                    ↓
   Setup    →    Tier 1: Minimal   →   Minimal Format
Implementation → Tier 2: Standard  →  Standard Format
 Architecture  → Tier 3: Comprehensive → Comprehensive Format
```

This alignment ensures that:
- **Validation effort matches risk level**: Low-risk setup tasks get minimal validation; high-risk architecture tasks get comprehensive validation
- **Documentation detail matches complexity**: Simple tasks get brief documentation; complex tasks get extensive documentation
- **Resources are allocated efficiently**: More effort spent on complex, high-risk work; less effort on simple, low-risk work

#### Why Alignment Matters

**1. Prevents Over-Validation of Simple Tasks**

F1's approach validated every subtask with the same rigor, regardless of complexity:

```
Setup Task (Create directory):
- Syntax validation ✓
- Functional validation ✓
- Integration validation ✓
- Requirements compliance ✓
- ~800 line completion document
```

This is overkill for a task that just creates directories. The three-tier approach applies appropriate validation:

```
Setup Task (Create directory):
- Syntax validation ✓
- Artifact verification ✓
- Basic structure validation ✓
- ~200 line completion document
```

**2. Prevents Under-Validation of Complex Tasks**

F2's approach validated only at parent task level, which could miss issues in complex subtasks:

```
Architecture Task (Design orchestration):
- No validation until parent task complete
- Errors can compound across multiple subtasks
- Delayed feedback on design soundness
```

The three-tier approach applies comprehensive validation to architecture tasks:

```
Architecture Task (Design orchestration):
- Syntax validation ✓
- Functional validation ✓
- Design soundness validation ✓
- System integration validation ✓
- Edge case validation ✓
- ~800 line completion document with design decisions
```

**3. Provides Proportional Documentation**

The alignment principle ensures documentation detail is proportional to task complexity:

- **Setup tasks**: Brief notes about what was created (artifacts, basic structure)
- **Implementation tasks**: Standard details about implementation approach and functional validation
- **Architecture tasks**: Comprehensive documentation of design decisions, rationale, trade-offs, and lessons learned

This prevents both over-documentation (F1's 800-line docs for simple tasks) and under-documentation (F2's missing completion docs for complex subtasks).

#### Alignment in Practice

**Example 1: Setup Task**

```markdown
Task: Create directory structure
Complexity: Low (structural work, clear success criteria)
Validation: Tier 1 - Minimal (syntax + artifacts + basic structure)
Documentation: Tier 1 - Minimal (~200 lines, brief notes)
```

**Example 2: Implementation Task**

```markdown
Task: Implement TokenSelector class
Complexity: Medium (coding work, functional validation needed)
Validation: Tier 2 - Standard (syntax + functional + integration + requirements)
Documentation: Tier 2 - Standard (~500 lines, implementation details)
```

**Example 3: Architecture Task**

```markdown
Task: Design BuildOrchestrator architecture
Complexity: High (design work, affects system structure)
Validation: Tier 3 - Comprehensive (syntax + functional + design + system + edge cases)
Documentation: Tier 3 - Comprehensive (~800 lines, design decisions and rationale)
```

The alignment is clear: as complexity increases, validation depth and documentation detail increase proportionally.

### Objective Classification Benefits

The three-tier system provides objective classification criteria that reduce ambiguity and enable consistent application across different specs, team members, and AI agents.

#### 1. Clear Classification Criteria

Each tier has specific, measurable characteristics:

**Setup Tasks**:
- ✅ Creates directories, files, or configuration
- ✅ Low complexity with straightforward operations
- ✅ Minimal logic or decision-making required
- ✅ Clear success criteria based on artifact presence

**Implementation Tasks**:
- ✅ Writes code to implement specific functionality
- ✅ Medium complexity requiring understanding of requirements
- ✅ Functional validation needed to ensure correctness
- ✅ Integration focus connecting with existing code

**Architecture Tasks**:
- ✅ Makes architectural decisions affecting system structure
- ✅ High complexity requiring deep understanding of system
- ✅ Design validation needed for extensibility
- ✅ Pattern establishment creating abstractions other code will follow

These criteria are objective and observable, reducing subjective interpretation.

#### 2. Reduces Classification Ambiguity

F2's approach had ambiguity about when to create completion documentation:

**F2 Standard**: "One completion doc per primary task"

**Actual Practice**: Completion docs created for:
- All primary tasks (10 docs)
- Complex subtasks (~18 docs)
- Simple subtasks (0 docs)

**Problem**: No clear definition of "complex enough" to warrant documentation.

The three-tier approach eliminates this ambiguity:

**Three-Tier Standard**: "All subtasks receive completion documentation with detail appropriate to task type"

**Clear Practice**:
- Setup subtasks → Tier 1 documentation (always)
- Implementation subtasks → Tier 2 documentation (always)
- Architecture subtasks → Tier 3 documentation (always)
- Parent tasks → Tier 3 documentation with success criteria (always)

**Result**: 100% completion doc coverage with no ambiguity about when to document.

#### 3. Enables Consistent AI Agent Execution

AI agents struggle with subjective decisions. The three-tier system provides objective rules:

**Subjective (F2 Approach)**:
```
AI Agent: "Is this subtask complex enough to warrant completion documentation?"
→ Requires subjective judgment
→ Inconsistent application
→ Potential for missing important documentation
```

**Objective (Three-Tier Approach)**:
```
AI Agent: "What is the task type?"
→ Setup: Apply Tier 1 validation and documentation
→ Implementation: Apply Tier 2 validation and documentation
→ Architecture: Apply Tier 3 validation and documentation
→ Consistent application across all tasks
```

The task type metadata in tasks.md makes this completely unambiguous:

```markdown
- [ ] 1.1 Create directory structure
  **Type**: Setup
  **Validation**: Tier 1 - Minimal
```

The AI agent knows exactly which tier to apply without subjective interpretation.

#### 4. Facilitates Human-AI Collaboration

The objective classification criteria create a shared language for human-AI collaboration:

**Human**: "This is a Setup task"
**AI Agent**: Understands this means Tier 1 validation and documentation

**Human**: "This is an Architecture task"
**AI Agent**: Understands this means Tier 3 validation and documentation with design decisions

This shared understanding enables reliable collaboration without ambiguity or misinterpretation.

#### 5. Supports Systematic Skepticism

Objective criteria enable evidence-based validation of classification decisions:

**Question**: "Should this task be Implementation or Architecture?"

**Objective Analysis**:
- Does it make architectural decisions affecting system structure? → Architecture
- Does it implement specific functionality within established patterns? → Implementation

**Evidence-Based Decision**: Classification based on observable characteristics, not subjective opinion.

This aligns with the AI Collaboration Framework's emphasis on systematic skepticism and evidence-based decision-making.

#### 6. Enables Continuous Improvement

Objective classification creates data that can be analyzed for continuous improvement:

**Metrics**:
- Classification consistency: % of tasks classified without human clarification
- Validation effectiveness: % of errors caught at appropriate tier
- Documentation usefulness: Feedback on documentation quality by tier

**Analysis**:
- Are Setup tasks consistently classified? (Target: >95%)
- Are Implementation tasks catching functional errors? (Target: >90%)
- Are Architecture tasks preserving design knowledge? (Target: >85%)

This data-driven approach enables systematic refinement of the classification system over time.

### Summary: Why Three Tiers with Objective Classification

The three-tier approach with objective classification criteria provides:

1. **Natural Work Categories**: Setup, Implementation, Architecture map to how developers think
2. **Balanced Granularity**: Sufficient distinction without excessive complexity
3. **Alignment Principle**: Validation depth = Documentation detail = Task complexity
4. **Objective Criteria**: Clear, measurable characteristics for each tier
5. **Reduced Ambiguity**: 100% completion doc coverage with no subjective decisions
6. **Consistent Application**: AI agents can apply the system reliably
7. **Shared Language**: Human-AI collaboration based on objective understanding
8. **Continuous Improvement**: Data-driven refinement of classification system

This approach addresses F2's quality concerns (delayed error detection, reduced checkpoints, inconsistent application) while maintaining reasonable token efficiency through proportional validation and documentation.

### Token Impact Analysis

4. **Documentation Coverage**: Three-Tier achieves 100% coverage vs F1's 95% and F2's 68%

#### Token Distribution by Tier

**Three-Tier Breakdown by Task Type**

| Task Type | Count | Validation Tokens | Documentation Lines | Total Tokens | % of Total |
|-----------|-------|------------------|---------------------|--------------|------------|
| **Setup** | 10 | ~500 | ~2,000 | ~2,500 | 7% |

**Distribution Insights**:

- **Parent tasks consume 49% of tokens**: This is appropriate as parent tasks require comprehensive validation and integration documentation
- **Implementation tasks consume 28% of tokens**: The largest category of subtasks receives proportional resources
- **Setup tasks consume only 7% of tokens**: Minimal validation and documentation for low-risk structural work
- **Architecture tasks consume 16% of tokens**: Comprehensive documentation for high-impact design decisions

#### Efficiency Gains Analysis

**Where Three-Tier Saves Tokens vs F1**

1. **Setup Task Efficiency**
   - **F1**: 10 setup tasks × ~800 lines = ~8,000 lines
   - **Three-Tier**: 10 setup tasks × ~200 lines = ~2,000 lines
   - **Savings**: ~6,000 lines (~15% of F1 total)

2. **Implementation Task Efficiency**
   - **F1**: 15 implementation tasks × ~800 lines = ~12,000 lines
   - **Three-Tier**: 15 implementation tasks × ~500 lines = ~7,500 lines
   - **Savings**: ~4,500 lines (~12% of F1 total)

3. **Validation Efficiency**
   - **F1**: 39 cycles × ~200 tokens = ~7,800 tokens (uniform depth)
   - **Three-Tier**: 40 cycles with variable depth = ~11,500 tokens (appropriate depth)
   - **Cost**: +~3,700 tokens (but with better quality)

**Net Result**: Three-Tier saves ~10,500 lines in documentation but invests ~3,700 more tokens in validation, resulting in ~5% overall savings with significantly better quality checkpoints.

#### Quality Improvements Analysis

**Where Three-Tier Improves Quality vs F2**

1. **Validation Frequency**
   - **F2**: 10 validation cycles (only at parent level)
   - **Three-Tier**: 40 validation cycles (after every subtask)
   - **Improvement**: **+300% more validation checkpoints**

2. **Completion Documentation Coverage**
   - **F2**: 68% of subtasks documented (28/41)
   - **Three-Tier**: 100% of subtasks documented (40/40)
   - **Improvement**: **+32% documentation coverage**

3. **Error Detection Timing**
   - **F2**: Errors accumulate until parent task validation (delayed detection)
   - **Three-Tier**: Errors caught immediately after each subtask (immediate detection)
   - **Improvement**: **Immediate error detection** prevents error compounding

4. **Documentation Depth Appropriateness**
   - **F2**: Uniform ~400 lines per doc (regardless of complexity)
   - **Three-Tier**: Variable depth matched to complexity (~200 to ~1,200 lines)
   - **Improvement**: **Proportional documentation** - more detail where needed, less where not

5. **Knowledge Preservation**
   - **F2**: Less architectural discussion, fewer code examples, shorter lessons learned
   - **Three-Tier**: Comprehensive architectural documentation for Architecture and Parent tasks
   - **Improvement**: **Better knowledge preservation** for complex design decisions

#### Token Investment Justification

**Why Three-Tier's Token Investment is Justified**

The three-tier approach invests ~24,000 more tokens than F2 (~37,000 vs ~13,000) to achieve:

1. **300% More Validation Checkpoints**: Errors caught immediately rather than accumulating
2. **100% Completion Doc Coverage**: No gaps in documentation or knowledge preservation
3. **Immediate Error Detection**: Issues identified and fixed before they compound
4. **Proportional Documentation**: Appropriate detail for task complexity
5. **Comprehensive Architecture Documentation**: Design decisions and rationale preserved

**Cost-Benefit Analysis**:

| Benefit | F2 | Three-Tier | Value |
|---------|-----|-----------|-------|
| **Error Detection Speed** | Delayed | Immediate | High |
| **Documentation Coverage** | 68% | 100% | High |
| **Validation Frequency** | 10 cycles | 40 cycles | High |
| **Knowledge Preservation** | Moderate | Comprehensive | High |
| **Token Efficiency** | 13,200 | 37,000 | Moderate |

**Conclusion**: The ~24,000 token investment delivers high value across multiple quality dimensions, justifying the cost.

#### Projected Token Usage for Typical Spec

**Typical Spec Structure** (based on F1 and F2 patterns):

- **10 parent tasks** (Tier 3 - Comprehensive with success criteria)
- **10 setup subtasks** (Tier 1 - Minimal)
- **15 implementation subtasks** (Tier 2 - Standard)
- **5 architecture subtasks** (Tier 3 - Comprehensive)

**Projected Token Calculation**:

| Component | Calculation | Tokens |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Setup Completion Docs** | 10 × ~200 lines | ~2,000 lines |
| **Implementation Completion Docs** | 15 × ~500 lines | ~7,500 lines |
| **Architecture Completion Docs** | 5 × ~800 lines | ~4,000 lines |
| **Parent Completion Docs** | 10 × ~1,200 lines | ~12,000 lines |
| **Setup Validation** | 10 × ~50 tokens | ~500 tokens |
| **Implementation Validation** | 15 × ~200 tokens | ~3,000 tokens |
| **Architecture Validation** | 5 × ~400 tokens | ~2,000 tokens |
| **Parent Validation** | 10 × ~600 tokens | ~6,000 tokens |
| **Total** | All components | **~37,000 tokens** |

**Comparison to Actual Specs**:
- **F1 Actual**: ~39,000 tokens (10 parent, 39 subtasks)
- **F2 Actual**: ~13,200 tokens (10 parent, 41 subtasks)
- **Three-Tier Projected**: ~37,000 tokens (10 parent, 40 subtasks)

The three-tier projection aligns closely with F1's actual token usage while providing more structured validation and 100% completion doc coverage.

## Decision-Making Process

This section documents the systematic decision-making process that led to the three-tier validation and documentation system. The process followed the AI Collaboration Framework's principles of systematic skepticism, evidence-based validation, and human-AI collaborative decision-making.

### Overview of Decision-Making Approach

The three-tier system was developed through a structured process that:

1. **Started with evidence**: Quantitative analysis of F1 vs F2 execution patterns
2. **Applied systematic skepticism**: Challenged assumptions and considered counter-arguments
3. **Evaluated alternatives**: Compared multiple approaches (two-tier, three-tier, four-tier)
4. **Used objective criteria**: Made decisions based on measurable characteristics
5. **Involved human-AI collaboration**: Combined human vision with AI analysis
6. **Validated with data**: Projected token usage and quality metrics

This process ensured that the three-tier system was not just theoretically sound but practically justified through evidence and rigorous analysis.

### Phase 1: Problem Identification (Evidence-Based)

#### Initial Observation

**Human (Peter)**: "F2 execution feels less refined than F1, even though it's more token-efficient."

**AI Response**: Initial skepticism - requested evidence to validate the feeling.

#### Quantitative Analysis

**Action**: Conducted detailed audit of F1 vs F2 execution patterns (documented in `spec-execution-audit-f1-vs-f2.md`)

**Findings**:
- **Completion Doc Coverage**: 95% (F1) → 68% (F2) = -27%
- **Validation Frequency**: 39 cycles (F1) → 10 cycles (F2) = -75%
- **Documentation Depth**: ~800 lines (F1) → ~400 lines (F2) = -50%
- **Token Usage**: ~39,000 (F1) → ~13,200 (F2) = -65%

**Evidence-Based Conclusion**: The "less refined" feeling was supported by objective metrics showing significant reductions in validation frequency, documentation coverage, and documentation depth.

#### Problem Statement

**Identified Issues with F2 Approach**:
1. **Delayed Error Detection**: Errors accumulate until parent task validation
2. **Reduced Checkpoints**: Fewer "save points" make debugging harder
3. **Inconsistent Documentation**: Ambiguity about when to create completion docs
4. **Less Knowledge Preservation**: Shorter docs with less architectural discussion

**Identified Issues with F1 Approach**:
1. **Over-Validation**: Simple setup tasks received same validation as complex architecture tasks
2. **Over-Documentation**: 800-line completion docs for straightforward tasks
3. **High Token Cost**: ~39,000 tokens per spec

**Challenge**: Find an approach that restores F2's quality while maintaining reasonable token efficiency.

### Phase 2: Alternative Approaches (Systematic Evaluation)

#### Alternative 1: Revert to F1 Approach

**Description**: Return to F1's pattern of validating and documenting every subtask with uniform depth.

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Proven approach with high quality
- ✅ Immediate error detection
- ✅ Comprehensive knowledge preservation
- ✅ Clear, consistent application

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ High token cost (~39,000 per spec)
- ❌ Over-validates simple tasks
- ❌ Over-documents straightforward work
- ❌ Doesn't address efficiency concerns

**Counter-Argument**: "F1 worked well - why change it?"

**Response**: F1's uniform approach doesn't match task complexity. A setup task creating directories doesn't need 800-line documentation with comprehensive validation. The token cost is justified for complex work but wasteful for simple work.

**Decision**: **Rejected** - Doesn't address efficiency concerns or proportional validation needs.

#### Alternative 2: Keep F2 Approach with Clarifications

**Description**: Maintain F2's parent-level validation but clarify when subtask completion docs are appropriate.

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Maintains token efficiency (~13,200 per spec)
- ✅ Minimal changes to current approach
- ✅ Faster execution

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ Doesn't address delayed error detection
- ❌ Doesn't restore incremental checkpoints
- ❌ Still ambiguous about "complex enough" for documentation
- ❌ Doesn't solve the "less refined" feeling

**Counter-Argument**: "F2 is simpler - just clarify the standards."

**Response**: The problem isn't lack of clarity - it's the fundamental approach of validating only at parent level. Clarifying standards doesn't restore the incremental quality gates that made F1 feel more refined.

**Decision**: **Rejected** - Doesn't address core quality concerns.

#### Alternative 3: Two-Tier System (Simple vs Complex)

**Description**: Classify tasks as either "Simple" or "Complex" with two corresponding validation and documentation tiers.

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Simpler than three tiers
- ✅ Easier classification (binary decision)
- ✅ Some proportionality in validation

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ Forces binary decisions that don't match reality
- ❌ No middle ground for standard implementation work
- ❌ Most tasks fall into "medium complexity" that doesn't fit either extreme
- ❌ Subjective classification ("Is this simple or complex?")

**Counter-Argument**: "Two tiers is simpler - why add a third tier?"

**Response**: Most development work falls into a "medium complexity" category - standard implementation tasks that aren't as simple as setup but aren't as complex as architecture. Forcing these into either "Simple" or "Complex" creates classification ambiguity and inappropriate validation depth.

**Decision**: **Rejected** - Doesn't provide sufficient granularity for real-world task complexity.

#### Alternative 4: Four-Tier System (Setup, Implementation, Architecture, Parent)

**Description**: Create four distinct tiers with separate validation and documentation standards for each.

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Maximum granularity
- ✅ Clear distinction between parent and architecture tasks
- ✅ Precise matching of validation to task type

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ Increased cognitive load during classification
- ❌ Diminishing returns on granularity
- ❌ Parent tasks and Architecture tasks both need comprehensive validation
- ❌ More complex mental model

**Counter-Argument**: "Four tiers provides better distinction - why combine Parent and Architecture?"

**Response**: Parent tasks and Architecture tasks both require comprehensive validation (syntax + functional + design + system + edge cases). The distinction is in documentation (Parent tasks add success criteria verification), which can be handled with conditional sections rather than a separate tier. Adding a fourth tier increases complexity without proportional benefit.

**Decision**: **Rejected** - Adds complexity without sufficient benefit; conditional sections can handle Parent-specific needs.

#### Alternative 5: Three-Tier System (Setup, Implementation, Architecture+Parent)

**Description**: Classify tasks into three tiers based on work type and complexity, with Parent tasks using Architecture tier plus conditional sections.

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Natural work categories (structural, coding, design)
- ✅ Objective classification criteria
- ✅ Balanced granularity (sufficient distinction without excessive complexity)
- ✅ Proportional validation and documentation
- ✅ Simple mental model (low, medium, high complexity)
- ✅ Handles Parent tasks with conditional sections

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ Parent tasks and Architecture tasks share same tier (less distinction)
- ❌ More complex than F2's approach
- ❌ Higher token cost than F2 (~37,000 vs ~13,200)

**Counter-Argument**: "This is more complex than F2 and costs more tokens - why not keep F2?"

**Response**: The token investment (~24,000 more than F2) delivers significant quality improvements: 300% more validation checkpoints, 100% completion doc coverage, immediate error detection, and comprehensive architecture documentation. The complexity is justified by objective classification criteria that eliminate ambiguity.

**Decision**: **Selected** - Provides optimal balance of quality, efficiency, and simplicity.

### Phase 3: Validation of Three-Tier Approach (Evidence-Based)

#### Token Impact Modeling

**Action**: Projected token usage for three-tier approach based on typical spec structure.

**Calculation**:
- 10 setup tasks × ~200 lines = ~2,000 lines
- 15 implementation tasks × ~500 lines = ~7,500 lines
- 5 architecture tasks × ~800 lines = ~4,000 lines
- 10 parent tasks × ~1,200 lines = ~12,000 lines
- Validation cycles: 40 cycles with variable depth = ~11,500 tokens
- **Total**: ~37,000 tokens

**Comparison**:
- **F1**: ~39,000 tokens (baseline)
- **Three-Tier**: ~37,000 tokens (-5% vs F1)
- **F2**: ~13,200 tokens (-65% vs F1)

**Conclusion**: Three-tier approach achieves ~5% token savings vs F1 while restoring quality checkpoints.

#### Quality Metrics Projection

**Action**: Projected quality improvements vs F2.

**Metrics**:
- **Validation Frequency**: 40 cycles (Three-Tier) vs 10 cycles (F2) = +300%
- **Completion Doc Coverage**: 100% (Three-Tier) vs 68% (F2) = +32%
- **Error Detection**: Immediate (Three-Tier) vs Delayed (F2) = Significant improvement
- **Documentation Appropriateness**: Variable depth (Three-Tier) vs Uniform (F2) = Better match to complexity

**Conclusion**: Three-tier approach delivers significant quality improvements across multiple dimensions.

#### Classification Objectivity Analysis

**Action**: Evaluated whether classification criteria are objective and unambiguous.

**Criteria Evaluation**:

| Task Type | Objective Criteria | Ambiguity Level |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Setup** | Creates directories, files, configuration; minimal logic | Low |
| **Implementation** | Writes code for specific functionality; functional validation needed | Low |
| **Architecture** | Makes architectural decisions; affects system structure | Low |

**Test Cases**:
- "Create directory structure" → Setup (clear)
- "Implement TokenSelector class" → Implementation (clear)
- "Design BuildOrchestrator architecture" → Architecture (clear)
- "Implement configuration validation logic" → Ambiguous (could be Implementation or Architecture)

**Ambiguity Handling**: For ambiguous cases, prompt human for clarification and document decision in Task Type Definitions.

**Conclusion**: Classification criteria are objective for ~90% of tasks; ambiguous cases have clear resolution process.

### Phase 4: Counter-Arguments and Responses (Systematic Skepticism)

#### Counter-Argument 1: "Three-tier is over-engineering"

**Argument**: The three-tier system adds unnecessary complexity. F2's simpler approach is sufficient.

**Response**:
- F2's simplicity came at the cost of quality (delayed error detection, reduced checkpoints, inconsistent documentation)
- Three-tier system adds minimal complexity (just task type classification during planning)
- Objective classification criteria eliminate execution-time ambiguity
- The complexity is justified by measurable quality improvements

**Evidence**: F2's "less refined" feeling was supported by objective metrics showing -27% documentation coverage, -75% validation frequency, and -50% documentation depth.

**Decision**: Complexity is justified by quality improvements and objective classification criteria.

#### Counter-Argument 2: "Token cost is too high compared to F2"

**Argument**: Three-tier approach costs ~24,000 more tokens than F2 (~37,000 vs ~13,200). This is a significant increase.

**Response**:
- Token investment delivers 300% more validation checkpoints
- Achieves 100% completion doc coverage vs F2's 68%
- Provides immediate error detection vs F2's delayed detection
- Preserves comprehensive architecture documentation
- Cost-benefit analysis shows high value across multiple quality dimensions

**Evidence**: Quality improvements (validation frequency, documentation coverage, error detection timing) justify the token investment.

**Decision**: Token investment is justified by significant quality improvements.

#### Counter-Argument 3: "Why not just improve F2 incrementally?"

**Argument**: Instead of creating a new system, just improve F2 by adding more validation checkpoints and clarifying documentation standards.

**Response**:
- F2's fundamental approach (parent-level validation only) is the problem
- Incremental improvements don't address the core issue of delayed error detection
- Three-tier system provides objective classification that F2 lacks
- "Improving F2" would essentially recreate the three-tier system

**Evidence**: The problem isn't execution of F2's standards - it's the standards themselves. Clarifying standards doesn't restore incremental quality gates.

**Decision**: Incremental improvements insufficient; systematic redesign needed.

#### Counter-Argument 4: "Classification will be inconsistent across specs"

**Argument**: Different people (or AI agents) will classify the same task differently, leading to inconsistency.

**Response**:
- Objective classification criteria reduce subjectivity
- Task Type Definitions document provides examples and guidance
- Ambiguous cases have clear resolution process (prompt human, document decision)
- Task type metadata in tasks.md makes classification explicit and auditable
- Living document approach allows refinement based on real-world patterns

**Evidence**: Classification criteria are objective for ~90% of tasks based on observable characteristics (structural vs coding vs design work).

**Decision**: Objective criteria and clear resolution process ensure consistency.

#### Counter-Argument 5: "This assumes task complexity is objective"

**Argument**: Task complexity is subjective - what one person considers "complex" another might consider "simple."

**Response**:
- Three-tier system doesn't classify by subjective "complexity"
- Classification based on objective work type (structural, coding, design)
- Characteristics are observable: Does it create directories? Does it write code? Does it make architectural decisions?
- Complexity is a result of work type, not the classification criterion

**Evidence**: Work type (Setup, Implementation, Architecture) is objectively observable based on what the task does, not how "complex" it feels.

**Decision**: Classification based on objective work type, not subjective complexity assessment.

### Phase 5: Human-AI Collaborative Decisions

#### Decision 1: Three Tiers vs Four Tiers

**AI Analysis**: Four tiers provide more granularity but add cognitive load. Parent tasks and Architecture tasks both need comprehensive validation.

**Human Input (Peter)**: "Parent tasks are fundamentally different from Architecture subtasks, but I see your point about validation needs being similar."

**Collaborative Decision**: Use three tiers with conditional sections for Parent-specific needs (success criteria verification). This provides distinction without additional tier complexity.

**Rationale**: Conditional sections handle Parent-specific documentation without requiring a separate validation tier. Keeps mental model simple while addressing Parent task needs.

**Documented In**: Design document, Section "Design Decisions - Decision 1: Three Tiers Instead of Four"

#### Decision 2: Task Type Classification Timing

**AI Analysis**: Classification could happen during planning (when creating tasks.md) or during execution (when implementing tasks).

**Human Input (Peter)**: "Classification during planning makes more sense - it removes ambiguity during execution and allows human oversight."

**Collaborative Decision**: Classify task types during planning phase and document in tasks.md with explicit Type metadata.

**Rationale**: Planning phase has full context of task structure and dependencies. Explicit metadata eliminates execution-time ambiguity and enables consistent AI agent application.

**Documented In**: Design document, Section "Design Decisions - Decision 2: Task Type Classification During Planning"

#### Decision 3: Completion Documentation for All Subtasks

**AI Analysis**: F2's selective documentation (68% coverage) created ambiguity. F1's comprehensive documentation (95% coverage) was clearer but potentially excessive.

**Human Input (Peter)**: "I want documentation for all subtasks, but with appropriate detail. A setup task doesn't need 800 lines."

**Collaborative Decision**: Create completion documentation for 100% of subtasks with detail matched to task type (Tier 1: ~200 lines, Tier 2: ~500 lines, Tier 3: ~800 lines).

**Rationale**: 100% coverage eliminates ambiguity about when to document. Variable detail ensures appropriate depth without over-documentation.

**Documented In**: Requirements document, Requirement 3.1; Design document, Section "Components and Interfaces - Completion Document Templates"

#### Decision 4: Living Task Type Definitions Document

**AI Analysis**: Task type definitions could be static (in Spec Planning Standards) or living (separate document that can be updated).

**Human Input (Peter)**: "I want this to evolve as we encounter new patterns. Make it a living document that we can update collaboratively."

**Collaborative Decision**: Create Task Type Definitions as a living document in `.kiro/steering/` with update history section for tracking new patterns and classification decisions.

**Rationale**: Living document enables continuous improvement as new task patterns emerge. Update history preserves decision-making rationale for future reference.

**Documented In**: Design document, Section "Design Decisions - Decision 4: Living Task Type Definitions Document"

#### Decision 5: Validation Aligned with Task Type

**AI Analysis**: Validation could be uniform (F1), parent-only (F2), or tiered by task type (three-tier).

**Human Input (Peter)**: "Validation should match the risk level. Simple tasks don't need comprehensive validation, but complex tasks do."

**Collaborative Decision**: Implement three-tier validation system where validation depth matches task type (Tier 1: Minimal, Tier 2: Standard, Tier 3: Comprehensive).

**Rationale**: Validation effort should be proportional to risk. Low-risk setup tasks need minimal validation; high-risk architecture tasks need comprehensive validation.

**Documented In**: Requirements document, Requirement 2; Design document, Section "Three-Tier Validation System"

### Phase 6: Rejected Approaches and Rationale

#### Rejected Approach 1: Percentage-Based Documentation

**Description**: Create completion docs for X% of subtasks based on importance or complexity.

**Why Rejected**:
- Creates ambiguity about which subtasks warrant documentation
- Subjective assessment of "important enough"
- Inconsistent application across specs
- Doesn't solve the fundamental problem of proportional documentation

**Alternative Chosen**: 100% completion doc coverage with variable detail matched to task type.

#### Rejected Approach 2: Validation Sampling

**Description**: Validate a sample of subtasks (e.g., every 3rd subtask) rather than all subtasks.

**Why Rejected**:
- Errors in non-validated subtasks could compound
- Sampling doesn't match risk level (might skip high-risk tasks)
- Creates uncertainty about validation coverage
- Doesn't provide the incremental checkpoints needed for quality

**Alternative Chosen**: Validate all subtasks with depth matched to task type.

#### Rejected Approach 3: Complexity Scoring System

**Description**: Assign complexity scores (1-10) to tasks and use score to determine validation/documentation depth.

**Why Rejected**:
- Complexity scoring is subjective
- Adds cognitive load during planning
- Doesn't provide clear classification criteria
- More complex than three-tier system without additional benefit

**Alternative Chosen**: Objective task type classification (Setup, Implementation, Architecture) based on work type.

#### Rejected Approach 4: Adaptive Validation

**Description**: Start with minimal validation and increase depth if errors are found.

**Why Rejected**:
- Reactive rather than proactive approach
- Errors must occur before validation depth increases
- Doesn't prevent errors, only responds to them
- Inconsistent validation depth across specs

**Alternative Chosen**: Proactive validation with depth matched to task type and risk level.

#### Rejected Approach 5: Tool-Based Automation

**Description**: Build automated tools to determine task type and validation needs.

**Why Rejected**:
- Premature automation before manual process is proven
- Tool complexity would exceed benefit
- Human judgment needed for ambiguous cases
- Violates process-first tool development principle

**Alternative Chosen**: Manual classification during planning with explicit metadata; tools can be added later if needed.

### Summary: Decision-Making Process Outcomes

#### Key Decisions Made

1. **Three-Tier System**: Setup, Implementation, Architecture+Parent (with conditional sections)
2. **Classification Timing**: During planning phase with explicit Type metadata in tasks.md
3. **Completion Documentation**: 100% coverage with variable detail matched to task type
4. **Living Definitions**: Task Type Definitions as evolving document with update history
5. **Aligned Validation**: Validation depth matched to task type and risk level

#### Decision-Making Principles Applied

1. **Evidence-Based**: Started with quantitative analysis of F1 vs F2 patterns
2. **Systematic Skepticism**: Challenged assumptions and considered counter-arguments
3. **Objective Criteria**: Used observable characteristics for classification
4. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Combined human vision with AI analysis
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Living document approach enables continuous improvement

#### Why These Decisions Are Sound

**Objective Foundation**: Classification based on observable work type (structural, coding, design) rather than subjective complexity assessment.

**Evidence-Based Validation**: Token projections and quality metrics support the three-tier approach's value proposition.

**Systematic Evaluation**: All alternatives (two-tier, four-tier, F1 revert, F2 clarification) were evaluated with clear rationale for rejection.

**Counter-Arguments Addressed**: Each major counter-argument was considered and responded to with evidence.

**Human-AI Collaboration**: Decisions combined human strategic vision (Peter's goals for the system) with AI analytical capabilities (quantitative analysis, projection modeling).

**Continuous Improvement**: Living document approach and update history enable refinement based on real-world usage patterns.

#### Alignment with AI Collaboration Framework

The decision-making process followed the AI Collaboration Framework principles:

**Mandatory Counter-Arguments**: Every major decision included counter-arguments and responses.

**Evidence-Based Validation**: Decisions supported by quantitative analysis and projected metrics.

**Systematic Skepticism**: Challenged assumptions about task complexity, classification objectivity, and token cost justification.

**Human-AI Collaborative Decisions**: Combined human strategic input with AI analytical capabilities.

**Objective Validation Gates**: Three-tier system provides objective criteria that AI agents can apply consistently.

This decision-making process demonstrates how systematic skepticism, evidence-based validation, and human-AI collaboration can produce well-reasoned solutions to complex problems.

## Recommendations 3 - Comprehensive)
- **Total: 40 tasks**

**Projected Token Usage**:

| Component | Calculation | Tokens |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Setup Tasks** | 10 × (~200 lines + ~50 validation) | ~2,500 |
| **Implementation Tasks** | 15 × (~500 lines + ~200 validation) | ~10,500 |
| **Architecture Tasks** | 5 × (~800 lines + ~400 validation) | ~6,000 |
| **Parent Tasks** | 10 × (~1,200 lines + ~600 validation) | ~18,000 |
| **Total** | All tasks | **~37,000 tokens** |

**Comparison to Historical Approaches**:

- **vs F1**: ~5% savings (~2,000 tokens) with better structure
- **vs F2**: +180% cost (~24,000 tokens) with restored quality

**Efficiency Ratio**:

- **F1**: ~795 tokens per task (39,000 ÷ 49 tasks)
- **F2**: ~259 tokens per task (13,200 ÷ 51 tasks)
- **Three-Tier**: ~925 tokens per task (37,000 ÷ 40 tasks)

**Note**: Three-Tier's higher per-task cost reflects 100% documentation coverage and validation after every subtask, compared to F2's selective documentation and parent-only validation.

#### Summary: Token Impact

**Key Findings**:

1. **Three-Tier achieves ~5% token savings vs F1** while providing more structured validation
2. **Three-Tier invests ~24,000 more tokens than F2** to restore quality checkpoints
3. **Token distribution is proportional to task complexity**: 7% (Setup), 28% (Implementation), 16% (Architecture), 49% (Parent)
4. **Quality improvements justify token investment**: 300% more validation checkpoints, 100% documentation coverage, immediate error detection
5. **Projected usage for typical spec: ~37,000 tokens** with 40 tasks

**Strategic Position**:

The three-tier approach positions between F1 and F2:
- **Closer to F1 in token usage** (~37,000 vs ~39,000) but with better structure
- **Significantly higher than F2** (~37,000 vs ~13,200) but with restored quality
- **Optimal balance**: Quality checkpoints restored while maintaining reasonable efficiency

This token investment is justified by the quality improvements and aligns with the goal of creating a reliable, systematic approach to spec execution that prevents the "less refined" feeling experienced with F2's approach.

## Decision-Making Process

[How we arrived at the three-tier system through systematic skepticism]

---

## Implementation Recommendations

This section provides practical guidance for applying the three-tier validation and documentation system to future specs, based on the analysis and decision-making process documented above.

### For Spec Planning Phase

#### 1. Task Type Classification

**When creating tasks.md**:

1. **Review each subtask** and identify its work type:
   - Does it create directories, files, or configuration? → Setup
   - Does it write code to implement functionality? → Implementation
   - Does it make architectural decisions or establish patterns? → Architecture

2. **Add explicit Type metadata** to each subtask:
   ```markdown
   - [ ] 1.1 Create directory structure
     **Type**: Setup
     **Validation**: Tier 1 - Minimal
   ```

3. **Reference Task Type Definitions** (`.kiro/steering/Task-Type-Definitions.md`) for examples and guidance

4. **Prompt human for clarification** if task type is ambiguous:
   - "This task could be Implementation or Architecture. Which is more appropriate?"
   - Document the decision and rationale

5. **Update Task Type Definitions** if new patterns emerge:
   - Add pattern to update history
   - Include date, classification decision, and rationale

#### 2. Success Criteria at Parent Level

**When defining parent tasks**:

1. **State overall goals** that encompass all subtasks
2. **Avoid repetition** - don't duplicate subtask details in success criteria
3. **Focus on integration** - how subtasks work together
4. **Make criteria verifiable** - provide clear evidence of completion

**Example**:
```markdown
- [ ] 1. Build System Foundation

  **Type**: Parent
  **Validation**: Tier 3 - Comprehensive (includes success criteria)
  
  **Success Criteria:**
  - Build system foundation established with clear architecture
  - Platform-specific generation working for web, iOS, and Android
  - Error handling comprehensive across all components
```

#### 3. Validation Planning

**When planning validation approach**:

1. **Setup tasks**: Plan for syntax + artifacts + basic structure validation
2. **Implementation tasks**: Plan for syntax + functional + integration + requirements validation
3. **Architecture tasks**: Plan for syntax + functional + design + system + edge cases + requirements validation
4. **Parent tasks**: Plan for all Architecture checks + success criteria verification + subtask integration

### For Spec Execution Phase

#### 1. Before Starting Task

**Preparation**:

1. **Review task type and validation tier** from tasks.md metadata
2. **Understand validation requirements** for that tier
3. **Plan implementation** to meet validation criteria
4. **Identify potential edge cases** (especially for Tier 3 tasks)

#### 2. During Implementation

**Incremental Validation**:

1. **Run getDiagnostics frequently** to catch syntax errors early
2. **Test functionality incrementally** as you build
3. **Verify integration points** as you connect with existing code
4. **Document decisions** as you make them (for completion doc)

#### 3. After Implementation

**Validation Execution**:

1. **Run complete validation** for the task's tier:
   - Tier 1: Syntax + Artifacts + Basic Structure
   - Tier 2: Syntax + Functional + Integration + Requirements
   - Tier 3: Syntax + Functional + Design + System + Edge Cases + Requirements

2. **Document validation results** in completion documentation:
   - List specific checks performed
   - Provide evidence for each check
   - Note any issues found and how they were resolved

3. **Fix validation failures** before proceeding:
   - Document what failed
   - Fix the issues
   - Re-run validation
   - Document resolution

#### 4. Completion Documentation

**Documentation Creation**:

1. **Use appropriate tier template**:
   - Tier 1 (Setup): Artifacts + Notes + Validation (~200 lines)
   - Tier 2 (Implementation): Artifacts + Details + Validation + Requirements (~500 lines)
   - Tier 3 (Architecture/Parent): Artifacts + Decisions + Algorithm + Validation + Lessons + Integration (~800-1,200 lines)

2. **Include all required sections** for that tier

3. **Provide specific evidence**:
   - Concrete examples
   - Test results
   - Validation outcomes

4. **Document lessons learned** (Tier 3 only):
   - What worked well
   - What was challenging
   - What would be done differently

5. **Save to correct location**:
   - `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/task-[N]-completion.md` (parent tasks)
   - `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/task-[N.M]-completion.md` (subtasks)

### For Quality Assurance

#### 1. Validation Metrics

**Track these metrics** to ensure system effectiveness:

- **Classification Consistency**: % of tasks classified without human clarification (Target: >90%)
- **Validation Effectiveness**: % of errors caught at appropriate tier (Target: >90%)
- **Documentation Coverage**: % of subtasks with completion docs (Target: 100%)
- **Error Detection Timing**: Errors caught immediately vs delayed (Target: Immediate)

#### 2. Continuous Improvement

**Regular Review**:

1. **Review classification decisions** after each spec:
   - Were any tasks difficult to classify?
   - Did classification criteria work well?
   - Should Task Type Definitions be updated?

2. **Review validation effectiveness**:
   - Were errors caught at appropriate times?
   - Was validation depth appropriate for task complexity?
   - Were any validation gaps identified?

3. **Review documentation usefulness**:
   - Was documentation detail appropriate?
   - Were completion docs helpful for understanding work?
   - Were lessons learned valuable?

4. **Update standards** based on findings:
   - Refine Task Type Definitions
   - Adjust validation criteria
   - Improve documentation templates

### For AI Agents

#### 1. Classification Guidance

**When classifying tasks**:

1. **Check task type metadata** in tasks.md first
2. **If metadata missing**, analyze task characteristics:
   - Structural work → Setup
   - Coding work → Implementation
   - Design work → Architecture

3. **If ambiguous**, prompt human:
   - "This task could be [Type A] or [Type B]. Which is more appropriate?"
   - Document decision in tasks.md

4. **If new pattern**, update Task Type Definitions:
   - Add to update history
   - Include date, pattern, decision, rationale

#### 2. Validation Execution

**When validating tasks**:

1. **Always start with getDiagnostics** (syntax validation)
2. **Follow tier-specific validation checklist**:
   - Tier 1: Syntax + Artifacts + Basic Structure
   - Tier 2: Syntax + Functional + Integration + Requirements
   - Tier 3: Syntax + Functional + Design + System + Edge Cases + Requirements

3. **Document all validation results** with specific checks
4. **Fix failures before proceeding** to next task
5. **Never skip validation** - it's critical for quality

#### 3. Documentation Creation

**When creating completion docs**:

1. **Use correct tier template** based on task type
2. **Include all required sections** for that tier
3. **Provide specific evidence** for validation results
4. **Write for future readers** - assume no context
5. **Document decisions and rationale** (especially Tier 3)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

#### 1. Classification Errors

**Pitfall**: Classifying implementation tasks as setup or vice versa

**Prevention**:
- Focus on work type, not perceived difficulty
- Use Task Type Definitions examples as reference
- When in doubt, prompt human for clarification

#### 2. Validation Shortcuts

**Pitfall**: Skipping validation steps to save time

**Prevention**:
- Follow tier-specific validation checklist completely
- Document all validation results
- Fix failures before proceeding

#### 3. Documentation Inconsistency

**Pitfall**: Using wrong tier template or missing required sections

**Prevention**:
- Check task type metadata before creating completion doc
- Use appropriate tier template
- Verify all required sections are included

#### 4. Ambiguity Tolerance

**Pitfall**: Proceeding with ambiguous classification rather than seeking clarification

**Prevention**:
- Prompt human when task type is unclear
- Document classification decision and rationale
- Update Task Type Definitions with new patterns

### Success Indicators

**The three-tier system is working well when**:

1. **Classification is consistent**: >90% of tasks classified without human clarification
2. **Validation is effective**: Errors caught at appropriate tier, not accumulating
3. **Documentation is complete**: 100% of subtasks have completion docs
4. **Documentation is appropriate**: Detail matches task complexity
5. **Execution feels refined**: Incremental checkpoints provide confidence
6. **Token usage is reasonable**: ~37,000 tokens per spec (between F1 and F2)
7. **Knowledge is preserved**: Future developers can understand decisions and rationale

### Troubleshooting

#### Issue: High classification ambiguity

**Symptoms**: Frequently needing human clarification for task type

**Solutions**:
- Review Task Type Definitions for clarity
- Add more examples to definitions
- Refine classification criteria based on patterns

#### Issue: Validation failures accumulating

**Symptoms**: Multiple validation failures at parent task level

**Solutions**:
- Validate more frequently during subtask implementation
- Run getDiagnostics more often during coding
- Test functionality incrementally

#### Issue: Documentation feels excessive

**Symptoms**: Completion docs feel too long for task complexity

**Solutions**:
- Verify correct tier template is being used
- Review whether task is correctly classified
- Adjust tier templates if consistently too verbose

#### Issue: Token usage exceeding projections

**Symptoms**: Specs consistently using >40,000 tokens

**Solutions**:
- Review whether tasks are correctly classified
- Check if documentation is more verbose than templates
- Verify validation is appropriate depth for tier

### Future Refinements

**Areas for potential improvement**:

1. **Task Type Definitions**: Add more examples as new patterns emerge
2. **Validation Criteria**: Refine based on effectiveness metrics
3. **Documentation Templates**: Adjust based on usefulness feedback
4. **Classification Criteria**: Improve based on ambiguity patterns
5. **Token Efficiency**: Optimize without sacrificing quality

**Process for refinements**:

1. **Gather evidence**: Metrics, feedback, observations
2. **Apply systematic skepticism**: Challenge assumptions
3. **Evaluate alternatives**: Consider multiple approaches
4. **Make evidence-based decisions**: Use data to support changes
5. **Document rationale**: Preserve decision-making process
6. **Validate improvements**: Measure impact of changes
