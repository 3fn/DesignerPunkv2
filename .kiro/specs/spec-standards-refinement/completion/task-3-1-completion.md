# Task 3.1 Completion: Update Completion Documentation Section

**Date**: January 20, 2025
**Task**: 3.1 Update Completion Documentation section
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/steering/File Organization Standards.md` (updated) - Added comprehensive completion documentation standards

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Updated the File Organization Standards document to clarify completion documentation practices for all subtasks. The update adds explicit standards for naming conventions, organization metadata, and location requirements that were previously implicit or unclear.

The changes were made to the "Spec-Specific Completion" section under "Organization Field Values" to provide clear, actionable guidance for creating completion documentation.

### Key Additions

**1. All Subtasks Clarification**
- Explicitly stated that completion documents are created for all subtasks
- Clarified this applies regardless of task type (Setup, Implementation, Architecture)
- Removes ambiguity about when completion docs are appropriate

**2. Naming Convention Specification**
- Parent tasks: `task-[N]-completion.md` format
- Subtasks: `task-[N.M]-completion.md` format
- Provided concrete examples for both formats

**3. Organization Metadata Confirmation**
- Confirmed all completion documents use `**Organization**: spec-completion`
- Ensures consistent metadata across all completion documentation

**4. Location Confirmation**
- Confirmed location: `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/` directory
- Provides clear directory structure for all completion docs

**5. Visual Examples**
- Added directory tree example showing naming convention in practice
- Demonstrates both parent task and subtask completion doc naming
- Uses real spec name (cross-platform-build-system) for clarity

### Integration Points

The updated File Organization Standards now aligns with:
- Spec Planning Standards three-tier completion documentation system
- Task Type Definitions validation and documentation tiers
- Development Workflow task completion practices

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ Markdown formatting correct
✅ Code blocks properly formatted

### Functional Validation
✅ All required clarifications added (all subtasks, naming convention, metadata, location)
✅ Examples provided showing naming convention in practice
✅ Directory structure example updated to reflect naming convention
✅ Standards are clear and actionable

### Integration Validation
✅ Aligns with Spec Planning Standards completion documentation system
✅ Consistent with Task Type Definitions approach
✅ Integrates with existing File Organization Standards structure
✅ No conflicts with other sections of the document

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 6.1: Clarified completion docs created for all subtasks
✅ Requirement 6.2: Specified naming convention with examples
✅ Requirement 6.3: Confirmed organization metadata (spec-completion)
✅ Requirement 6.4: Confirmed location (.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/)
✅ Requirement 3.6: Added examples showing naming convention

## Requirements Compliance

**Requirement 6.1**: Clarify completion docs for all subtasks
- ✅ Added explicit statement: "Completion documents are created for all subtasks, regardless of task type"

**Requirement 6.2**: Specify naming convention

**Requirement 6.3**: Confirm organization metadata
- ✅ Confirmed: All completion documents use `**Organization**: spec-completion`

**Requirement 6.4**: Confirm location
- ✅ Confirmed: `.kiro/specs/[spec-name]/completion/` directory

**Requirement 3.6**: Add examples
- ✅ Added directory tree example showing 7 completion docs with proper naming
- ✅ Included both parent task and subtask examples
- ✅ Used real spec name for clarity
