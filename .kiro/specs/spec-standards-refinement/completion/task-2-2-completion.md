# Task 2.2 Completion: Add Three-Tier Validation System Section

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Task**: 2.2 Add Three-Tier Validation System section  
**Type**: Implementation  
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- Updated `.kiro/steering/Spec Planning Standards.md` with new "Three-Tier Validation System" section

## Implementation Details

Added a comprehensive "Three-Tier Validation System" section to the Spec Planning Standards document that defines validation requirements for each task type. The section was strategically placed after the Task Type Classification System and before the Spec Workflow section, creating a logical flow from task classification → validation → workflow execution.

### Section Structure

The new section includes:

1. **Overview**: Explains the purpose and benefits of the three-tier validation system
2. **Validation Principles**: Core principles guiding validation approach
3. **Tier 1: Minimal Validation**: Complete definition for Setup tasks with specific checks and examples
4. **Tier 2: Standard Validation**: Complete definition for Implementation tasks with specific checks and examples
5. **Tier 3: Comprehensive Validation**: Complete definition for Architecture tasks with specific checks and examples
6. **Tier 3: Parent Task Additions**: Additional validation checks specific to Parent tasks
7. **Validation Workflow**: Step-by-step guidance for applying validation during task execution
8. **Validation Failure Handling**: Detailed process for handling and documenting validation failures
9. **Validation Best Practices**: Practical guidance for effective validation

### Key Design Decisions

**Specific, Measurable Checks**: Each tier includes concrete validation checks that AI agents can apply objectively (e.g., "Run getDiagnostics", "Verify functional correctness", "Check edge cases").

**Progressive Complexity**: Validation tiers build on each other - Tier 2 includes all Tier 1 checks plus additional checks, and Tier 3 includes all Tier 2 checks plus comprehensive checks.

**Parent Task Distinction**: Parent tasks use Tier 3 validation with additional checks for subtask integration and success criteria verification, clearly distinguishing them from Architecture tasks.

**Practical Examples**: Each tier includes detailed validation examples showing exactly what documentation should look like, making it easy for AI agents to follow the pattern.

**Failure Handling**: Included comprehensive guidance on handling validation failures with documentation examples showing initial failure, resolution steps, and final validation results.

### Integration with Existing Content

The section integrates seamlessly with:
- **Task Type Classification System**: References the three task types and explains how validation aligns with each
- **Spec Workflow**: Provides the validation details that support Phase 4: Implementation
- **Completion Documentation**: Validation results feed directly into completion documentation requirements

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors in Spec Planning Standards.md
✅ Markdown formatting correct throughout new section

### Functional Validation
✅ Section defines Tier 1: Minimal validation with specific checks (syntax, artifacts, basic structure)
✅ Section defines Tier 2: Standard validation with specific checks (syntax, functional, integration, requirements)
✅ Section defines Tier 3: Comprehensive validation with specific checks (syntax, functional, design, system integration, edge cases, requirements)
✅ Section clarifies Parent task additions to Tier 3 (subtask integration, success criteria verification, end-to-end functionality)
✅ Examples provided for each tier showing validation documentation format
✅ Validation workflow guidance included for task execution
✅ Validation failure handling process documented with examples

### Integration Validation
✅ Section placed logically after Task Type Classification System
✅ Section references task types defined earlier in document
✅ Section integrates with Spec Workflow section that follows
✅ Validation examples align with completion documentation format
✅ Terminology consistent with rest of document (getDiagnostics, task types, tiers)

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 5.2: Spec Planning Standards includes section defining three validation tiers with specific checks
✅ Requirement 2.1: Tier 1 Minimal validation defined with specific checks (getDiagnostics, artifacts verification, basic structure)
✅ Requirement 2.2: Tier 2 Standard validation defined with specific checks (getDiagnostics, functional correctness, integration, requirements compliance)
✅ Requirement 2.3: Tier 3 Comprehensive validation defined with specific checks (getDiagnostics, functional, design soundness, system integration, edge cases, requirements)
✅ Requirement 2.4: Parent task additions to Tier 3 clarified (subtask integration verification, success criteria verification, end-to-end functionality, requirements coverage)
✅ Examples provided for each tier as required

## Implementation Approach

### Content Development

1. **Researched Requirements**: Reviewed requirements 2.1-2.4 and 5.2 to understand exact validation checks needed for each tier
2. **Structured Hierarchically**: Organized content from overview → principles → tier definitions → workflow → best practices
3. **Provided Concrete Examples**: Created detailed validation examples for each tier showing exact documentation format
4. **Distinguished Parent Tasks**: Clearly separated Parent task validation from Architecture task validation while maintaining Tier 3 classification
5. **Added Practical Guidance**: Included validation workflow and failure handling to support AI agents during execution

### Writing Approach

- **Objective Language**: Used specific, measurable terms (e.g., "Run getDiagnostics", "Verify all specified artifacts")
- **Consistent Formatting**: Maintained document's existing formatting patterns (bold for emphasis, checkboxes for examples)
- **Progressive Detail**: Started with overview and principles, then provided increasing detail for each tier
- **Actionable Guidance**: Focused on what AI agents should do, not just what validation is

## Lessons Learned

### Validation Tier Distinction

The key challenge was clearly distinguishing Parent task validation from Architecture task validation while both use Tier 3. The solution was to present Tier 3 for Architecture tasks first, then add a separate subsection for Parent task additions. This makes it clear that Parent tasks include all Architecture validation plus additional checks.

### Example Quality

Providing detailed validation examples for each tier significantly improves clarity. The examples show not just what checks to perform, but exactly how to document the results. This reduces ambiguity for AI agents executing tasks.

### Failure Handling Importance

Including validation failure handling with before/after examples provides a complete picture of the validation process. This helps AI agents understand that validation failures are normal and provides a clear path to resolution.

## Integration Points

### Task Type Classification System

The validation system directly references the three task types (Setup, Implementation, Architecture) defined in the Task Type Classification System section. Each task type maps to a specific validation tier, creating a clear connection between classification and validation.

### Completion Documentation

Validation results documented according to these tiers will be included in completion documentation. The validation examples in this section align with the completion documentation format, ensuring consistency across the spec execution process.

### Spec Workflow

The validation system supports Phase 4: Implementation of the Spec Workflow by providing the specific validation checks that should be performed after each task completion. This creates an incremental quality gate system that catches errors early.

*This implementation establishes clear, objective validation standards that align with task complexity and enable consistent AI agent execution while maintaining appropriate quality gates throughout spec implementation.*
