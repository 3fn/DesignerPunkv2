# Task 2.4 Completion: Update Tasks Document Format Section

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Task**: 2.4 Update Tasks Document Format section
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- Updated `.kiro/steering/Spec Planning Standards.md` - Tasks Document Format section

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Updated the Tasks Document Format section in Spec Planning Standards to include Type and Validation metadata fields for all tasks. Added comprehensive examples demonstrating all three task types (Setup, Implementation, Architecture) plus Parent tasks to provide clear guidance for spec creators and AI agents.

The update focused on making task type classification explicit and unambiguous through metadata fields, ensuring AI agents can determine the appropriate validation and documentation tier without interpretation.

### Key Changes

**1. Updated Structure Template**
- Added **Type** metadata field to parent tasks (Type: Parent)
- Added **Validation** metadata field to parent tasks (Tier 3 - Comprehensive)
- Added **Type** metadata field to subtasks with options: Setup, Implementation, Architecture
- Added **Validation** metadata field to subtasks with tier specifications

**2. Added Task Type Metadata Principle**
- Documented that all subtasks must include Type metadata
- Documented that all subtasks must include Validation metadata
- Clarified that Type determines validation and documentation tier
- Specified Parent tasks use Type: Parent with Tier 3 validation

**3. Created Comprehensive Examples Section**
Added five detailed examples showing:
- **Example 1**: Parent task with mixed subtask types (Setup, Implementation, Architecture)
- **Example 2**: Setup task with Tier 1 - Minimal validation
- **Example 3**: Implementation task with Tier 2 - Standard validation
- **Example 4**: Architecture task with Tier 3 - Comprehensive validation
- **Example 5**: Complete feature demonstrating all task types together

### Integration Points

The updated format integrates with:
- **Task Type Classification System**: References the three task types defined earlier in the document
- **Three-Tier Validation System**: Explicitly links task types to validation tiers
- **Three-Tier Completion Documentation System**: Connects task types to documentation requirements
- **Task Type Definitions**: Points to the detailed definitions document for classification guidance

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors in Spec Planning Standards.md
✅ Markdown formatting correct throughout
✅ Code block syntax valid

### Functional Validation
✅ Type metadata field added to task format structure
✅ Validation metadata field added to task format structure
✅ Examples show all three task types (Setup, Implementation, Architecture)
✅ Examples show Parent task format with success criteria
✅ Examples demonstrate proper metadata usage
✅ Format is clear and unambiguous for AI agents

### Integration Validation
✅ Updated format aligns with Task Type Classification System section
✅ Validation tiers match Three-Tier Validation System definitions
✅ Examples reference requirements appropriately
✅ Format consistent with existing spec examples (F1, F2)

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 5.4: Tasks.md format examples include task type metadata
✅ Requirement 4.1: Each subtask includes Type metadata field
✅ Requirement 4.2: Setup tasks specify Tier 1 - Minimal validation
✅ Requirement 4.3: Implementation tasks specify Tier 2 - Standard validation
✅ Requirement 4.4: Architecture tasks specify Tier 3 - Comprehensive validation
✅ Requirement 4.5: Parent tasks include Type: Parent with Tier 3 validation
✅ Requirement 4.6: Validation level explicitly documented in task metadata

## Requirements Compliance

### Requirement 5.4: Tasks.md Format Examples
The updated section includes comprehensive examples showing task type metadata in the tasks.md format. Five distinct examples demonstrate:
- Parent task format with Type: Parent
- Setup task format with Type: Setup and Tier 1 validation
- Implementation task format with Type: Implementation and Tier 2 validation
- Architecture task format with Type: Architecture and Tier 3 validation
- Complete feature showing all types working together

### Requirement 4.1: Type Metadata Field
All subtask examples now include the **Type** metadata field with clear options: Setup, Implementation, or Architecture. The format template explicitly shows where this field should be placed.

### Requirement 4.2-4.4: Task Type to Tier Mapping
Examples clearly demonstrate the mapping:
- Type: Setup → Validation: Tier 1 - Minimal
- Type: Implementation → Validation: Tier 2 - Standard
- Type: Architecture → Validation: Tier 3 - Comprehensive

### Requirement 4.5: Parent Task Format
Parent tasks are shown with Type: Parent and Validation: Tier 3 - Comprehensive (includes success criteria), making the distinction clear.

### Requirement 4.6: Explicit Validation Documentation
Every example includes the **Validation** metadata field that explicitly documents which tier applies, removing any ambiguity about validation requirements.

## Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions

**Decision 1**: Separate Type and Validation fields
- **Rationale**: While Type determines Validation tier, keeping them separate makes the relationship explicit and allows for future flexibility
- **Alternative**: Could have used only Type field and inferred validation tier
- **Chosen approach**: Explicit is better than implicit for AI agent clarity

**Decision 2**: Five comprehensive examples
- **Rationale**: Multiple examples showing different scenarios helps both humans and AI agents understand the format in various contexts
- **Alternative**: Could have provided just one or two examples
- **Chosen approach**: Comprehensive examples reduce ambiguity and provide reference patterns

**Decision 3**: Inline metadata format
- **Rationale**: Placing Type and Validation metadata immediately after the task checkbox makes it visually clear and easy to parse
- **Alternative**: Could have used a different metadata format or location
- **Chosen approach**: Consistent with existing metadata patterns in the document

### Clarity Improvements

The examples progress from simple to complex:
1. Start with a parent task showing all three subtask types
2. Show individual task type examples in isolation
3. End with a complete feature demonstrating real-world usage

This progression helps readers understand the format incrementally while providing comprehensive reference material.

### AI Agent Considerations

The format is designed to be unambiguous for AI agents:
- Type field has clear, limited options (Setup, Implementation, Architecture, Parent)
- Validation field explicitly states the tier (no inference needed)
- Examples show exact syntax and formatting
- Metadata placement is consistent across all examples

## Next Steps

This task completes the update to the Tasks Document Format section. The next task (2.5) will update the Implementation Workflow section to incorporate task type classification into the planning and execution phases.

The updated format is now ready for use in creating new specs and can serve as a reference for AI agents executing tasks.
