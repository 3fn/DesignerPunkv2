**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Task**: 4.1 Create audit summary structure  
**Type**: Setup  
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/specs/spec-standards-refinement/completion/audit-summary.md` - Audit summary document with complete section structure

## Implementation Notes

Created the audit summary document with all required metadata fields and section structure as specified in the design document. The file includes:

- Metadata header with date, purpose, organization (spec-completion), and scope (spec-standards-refinement)
- Five main sections: Executive Summary, F1 vs F2 Comparative Analysis, Three-Tier Approach Rationale, Decision-Making Process, and Implementation Recommendations
- Placeholder content for each section to guide future content development
- Subsections within F1 vs F2 Analysis (Quantitative Findings, Quality Impact) and Three-Tier Rationale (Why Three Tiers, Token Impact Analysis)

The structure follows the template provided in the design document and is ready for content population in subsequent tasks.
