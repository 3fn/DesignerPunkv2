# Task 2.7 Completion: Update Examples Throughout Document

**Date**: January 10, 2025
**Task**: 2.7 Update examples throughout document
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

No new files created - updated existing `.kiro/steering/Spec Planning Standards.md` document

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Conducted a comprehensive review of the Spec Planning Standards document to verify that all examples include Type metadata and show three-tier formats. The review covered:

1. **Task Format Examples section** - Verified all task examples include Type and Validation metadata
2. **Three-Tier Validation System section** - Verified all validation examples show tier-specific checks
3. **Three-Tier Completion Documentation System section** - Verified all completion doc templates and examples show tier-specific formats
4. **Spec Workflow section** - Verified workflow references task type classification and validation by tier

### Key Findings

Upon thorough review, all examples in the document were already updated with Type metadata and three-tier formats from previous tasks (2.1-2.6). Specifically:

**Task Format Examples (5 examples)**:
- Example 1: Parent Task with Mixed Subtask Types - ✅ Includes Type and Validation metadata for all subtasks
- Example 2: Setup Task (Tier 1 - Minimal) - ✅ Includes Type and Validation metadata
- Example 3: Implementation Task (Tier 2 - Standard) - ✅ Includes Type and Validation metadata
- Example 4: Architecture Task (Tier 3 - Comprehensive) - ✅ Includes Type and Validation metadata
- Example 5: Complete Feature with All Task Types - ✅ Includes Type and Validation metadata for all subtasks

**Validation Examples (4 examples)**:
- Tier 1: Minimal Validation example - ✅ Shows tier-specific checks
- Tier 2: Standard Validation example - ✅ Shows tier-specific checks
- Tier 3: Comprehensive Validation (Architecture) example - ✅ Shows tier-specific checks
- Tier 3: Comprehensive Validation (Parent Task) example - ✅ Shows tier-specific checks with success criteria

**Completion Documentation Examples (4 examples)**:
- Tier 1: Minimal Documentation template and example - ✅ Shows tier-specific format
- Tier 2: Standard Documentation template and example - ✅ Shows tier-specific format
- Tier 3: Comprehensive Documentation (Architecture) template - ✅ Shows tier-specific format
- Tier 3: Comprehensive Documentation (Parent Task) example - ✅ Shows tier-specific format with success criteria

**Workflow References**:
- Phase 3: Tasks - ✅ References task type classification with Type and Validation metadata
- Phase 4: Implementation - ✅ References validation by tier and completion documentation by tier

### Consistency Verification

All examples throughout the document demonstrate:
- ✅ Consistent use of Type metadata field (Setup, Implementation, Architecture, Parent)
- ✅ Consistent use of Validation metadata field (Tier 1: Minimal, Tier 2: Standard, Tier 3: Comprehensive)
- ✅ Consistent validation check structure for each tier
- ✅ Consistent completion documentation format for each tier
- ✅ Clear distinction between task types and their corresponding tiers

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors in Spec Planning Standards document
✅ All markdown formatting correct
✅ All code blocks properly formatted

### Functional Validation
✅ All task examples include Type and Validation metadata
✅ All validation examples show tier-specific checks
✅ All completion doc examples show tier-specific formats
✅ Workflow section references task type classification and validation by tier

### Integration Validation
✅ Examples consistent with Task Type Definitions document
✅ Examples consistent with Three-Tier Validation System section
✅ Examples consistent with Three-Tier Completion Documentation System section
✅ All cross-references between sections accurate

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 5.4: All task examples include Type metadata
✅ Requirement 5.4: All completion doc examples show three-tier formats
✅ Requirement 5.4: All validation examples show three-tier checks
✅ Requirement 5.4: Consistency ensured across all examples

## Requirements Compliance

**Requirement 5.4**: WHEN reading Spec Planning Standards THEN it SHALL include examples of tasks.md format with task type metadata

- ✅ Task Format Examples section includes 5 comprehensive examples
- ✅ All examples show Type and Validation metadata fields
- ✅ Examples cover all task types (Setup, Implementation, Architecture, Parent)
- ✅ Examples demonstrate proper metadata format and usage

**Additional Coverage**:
- ✅ Validation examples demonstrate tier-specific checks for all three tiers
- ✅ Completion documentation examples demonstrate tier-specific formats for all three tiers
- ✅ Workflow section integrates task type classification guidance
- ✅ All examples maintain consistency with established standards

## Implementation Notes

This task served as a verification and quality assurance step to ensure that all previous updates (tasks 2.1-2.6) were properly integrated throughout the document. The comprehensive review confirmed that:

1. All examples were already updated with Type metadata from task 2.4
2. All validation examples were already updated with three-tier checks from task 2.2
3. All completion doc examples were already updated with three-tier formats from task 2.3
4. The workflow section was already updated with task type classification guidance from task 2.5

No additional changes were required, as the document already demonstrates complete consistency and adherence to the three-tier approach across all examples.
