# Task 2.5 Completion: Update Implementation Workflow Section

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Task**: 2.5 Update Implementation Workflow section
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/steering/Spec Planning Standards.md` (updated) - Enhanced Spec Workflow section with task type classification and validation by tier

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Updated the Spec Workflow section in the Spec Planning Standards document to integrate the three-tier task type classification system into both the planning phase (Phase 3: Tasks) and execution phase (Phase 4: Implementation). The updates provide clear, actionable guidance for AI agents and spec planners on when and how to classify tasks, validate by tier, and create appropriate completion documentation.

### Key Updates

**Phase 3: Tasks (Planning Phase)**
- Added step 3 with detailed task type classification process
- Included guidance to review task characteristics (structural vs coding vs design)
- Added instruction to assess complexity and risk levels
- Specified requirement to add Type and Validation metadata to each subtask
- Referenced Task Type Definitions document for classification guidance
- Added instruction to prompt human for clarification when task type is ambiguous

**Phase 4: Implementation (Execution Phase)**
- Added "Before starting task" step to review task type and validation tier requirements
- Expanded validation step (now step 4) with tier-specific validation requirements:
  - Tier 1 (Setup): Syntax + artifact verification + basic structure
  - Tier 2 (Implementation): Syntax + functional + integration + requirements compliance
  - Tier 3 (Architecture/Parent): Syntax + functional + design + system integration + edge cases + requirements
- Added instruction to fix validation failures before proceeding
- Expanded completion documentation step (now step 5) with tier-specific format guidance:
  - Tier 1: Minimal format with artifacts, notes, validation
  - Tier 2: Standard format with artifacts, details, validation, requirements
  - Tier 3: Comprehensive format with artifacts, decisions, algorithm, validation, lessons, integration
- Added final verification step to ensure all validation checks passed before moving to next task

### Integration Points

The updated Spec Workflow section now integrates seamlessly with:
- **Task Type Classification System** section (provides detailed classification guidance)
- **Three-Tier Validation System** section (provides specific validation checks for each tier)
- **Three-Tier Completion Documentation System** section (provides detailed format templates)
- **Task Type Definitions** document (`.kiro/steering/Task-Type-Definitions.md`) - referenced for classification help

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors
✅ Markdown formatting correct
✅ All references to other sections are accurate

### Functional Validation
✅ Phase 3 now includes task type classification step with clear process
✅ Phase 4 now includes validation by tier with specific requirements for each tier
✅ Phase 4 now includes completion documentation guidance with tier-specific formats
✅ Task Type Definitions document is referenced for classification help
✅ Workflow provides clear, actionable steps for AI agents

### Integration Validation
✅ Integrates with Task Type Classification System section
✅ Integrates with Three-Tier Validation System section
✅ Integrates with Three-Tier Completion Documentation System section
✅ References Task Type Definitions document correctly
✅ Workflow steps are consistent with other sections of the document

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 5.5: Guidance on task type classification during planning phase added to Phase 3
✅ Task type classification process clearly documented with step-by-step instructions
✅ Validation by tier added to Phase 4 with specific checks for each tier
✅ Completion documentation guidance updated with tier-specific format requirements
✅ Reference to Task Type Definitions document included for classification help

## Requirements Compliance

**Requirement 5.5**: "WHEN reading Spec Planning Standards THEN it SHALL include guidance on task type classification during planning phase"

✅ **Met**: Phase 3 (Tasks) now includes step 3 with comprehensive task type classification guidance:
- Review task characteristics
- Assess complexity and risk
- Assign task type
- Add Type and Validation metadata
- Reference Task Type Definitions for help
- Prompt human for clarification when needed

**Additional Requirements Addressed**:
- Validation by tier integrated into Phase 4 (Implementation)
- Completion documentation guidance updated with tier-specific formats
- Clear reference to Task Type Definitions document for classification help
- Workflow now provides end-to-end guidance from planning through execution

## Implementation Notes

The updates maintain the existing four-phase structure (Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation) while enhancing Phase 3 and Phase 4 with the three-tier system. The guidance is specific enough to be actionable but concise enough to be easily understood and followed.

The workflow now provides a complete picture of how task type classification flows from planning (Phase 3) through execution (Phase 4), ensuring AI agents understand when to classify tasks, how to validate by tier, and what documentation format to use.
