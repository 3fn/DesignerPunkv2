# Task 1 Completion: Create Task Type Definitions Document

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Task**: 1. Create Task Type Definitions Document  
**Type**: Implementation  
**Status**: Complete

---

## Artifacts Created

- `.kiro/steering/Task-Type-Definitions.md` - Complete task type definitions document with all three types defined

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Created a comprehensive Task Type Definitions document that serves as a living reference for classifying tasks during spec planning. The document provides clear definitions, characteristics, and examples for each of the three task types (Setup, Implementation, Architecture), along with their associated validation and documentation tiers.

### Key Implementation Decisions

1. **Structured by Task Type**: Organized the document with separate sections for each task type, making it easy to reference specific definitions during planning.

2. **Comprehensive Examples**: Provided 7 concrete examples for each task type (exceeding the 5+ requirement) to cover a wide range of common scenarios.

3. **Clear Characteristics**: Listed specific characteristics for each task type to enable objective classification decisions.

4. **Validation and Documentation Tiers**: Explicitly linked each task type to its appropriate validation tier and documentation tier.

5. **Living Document Structure**: Created an Update History section with clear guidelines and format for future refinements as new patterns emerge.

### Subtask Completion

All subtasks completed successfully:

- **1.1**: Document structure and metadata created with proper organization metadata (process-standard, cross-project)
- **1.2**: Setup task type defined with 7 examples and Tier 1 specifications
- **1.3**: Implementation task type defined with 7 examples and Tier 2 specifications
- **1.4**: Architecture task type defined with 7 examples and Tier 3 specifications
- **1.5**: Update History section created with template, guidelines, and example entry

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ getDiagnostics passed - no syntax errors in markdown document
✅ All markdown formatting is correct and renders properly
✅ Document structure is clear and navigable

### Functional Validation
✅ All three task types have clear definitions
✅ Each task type includes comprehensive characteristics
✅ Each task type provides 7 concrete examples (exceeds 5+ requirement)
✅ Validation tiers are explicitly specified for each task type
✅ Documentation tiers are explicitly specified for each task type
✅ Update History section includes format template and guidelines

### Integration Validation
✅ Document stored in `.kiro/steering/` as specified
✅ Organization metadata set to `process-standard` for cross-project use
✅ Scope set to `cross-project` for reusability
✅ Document integrates with Spec Planning Standards workflow
✅ Examples align with real tasks from F1 and F2 specs

### Requirements Compliance
✅ **Requirement 7.1**: Task Type Definitions document created and stored in .kiro/steering/
✅ **Requirement 7.2**: Setup tasks defined with 7 examples, characteristics, and Tier 1 specifications
✅ **Requirement 7.3**: Implementation tasks defined with 7 examples, characteristics, and Tier 2 specifications
✅ **Requirement 7.4**: Architecture tasks defined with 7 examples, characteristics, and Tier 3 specifications
✅ **Requirement 7.5**: Update History section created with template for future updates
✅ **Requirement 7.6**: Update format includes date, pattern, decision, rationale, and examples
✅ **Requirement 7.7**: Document includes proper metadata (date, purpose, organization, scope)

## Success Criteria Verification

✅ **Task Type Definitions document created with clear definitions for all three types**
   - Setup, Implementation, and Architecture task types all have comprehensive definitions with clear characteristics

✅ **At least 5 examples provided for each task type**
   - Setup: 7 examples provided
   - Implementation: 7 examples provided
   - Architecture: 7 examples provided

✅ **Update history section included for future refinements**
   - Update History section created with format template, guidelines, and example entry
   - Clear process for collaborative human-AI decision-making documented

✅ **Document stored in .kiro/steering/ as process standard**
   - File location: `.kiro/steering/Task-Type-Definitions.md`
   - Organization metadata: `process-standard`
   - Scope metadata: `cross-project`

## Overall Integration Story

The Task Type Definitions document serves as the foundational reference for the three-tier validation and documentation system. It provides:

1. **Objective Classification Criteria**: Clear characteristics enable consistent task type classification during spec planning
2. **Validation Guidance**: Explicit tier specifications guide execution practices
3. **Documentation Standards**: Documentation tier specifications ensure appropriate detail levels
4. **Living Document Framework**: Update History section enables continuous refinement as new patterns emerge

This document will be referenced by:
- Spec Planning Standards (for task classification guidance)
- AI agents during spec planning (to classify tasks objectively)
- Developers during task execution (to understand validation and documentation requirements)
- Future spec refinements (to update definitions based on new patterns)

The comprehensive examples drawn from real F1 and F2 spec tasks ensure the definitions are grounded in actual usage patterns rather than theoretical constructs.

*Task 1 complete. The Task Type Definitions document provides the foundation for the three-tier system and enables consistent task classification across all future specs.*
