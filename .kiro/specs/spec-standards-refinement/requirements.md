# Requirements Document: Spec Standards Refinement

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Spec**: Spec Standards Refinement  
**Status**: Requirements Phase  
**Dependencies**: None

---

## Introduction

This spec addresses quality concerns identified through comparative analysis of F1 (Mathematical Token System) and F2 (Cross-Platform Build System) execution patterns. The audit revealed that changes made to reduce token usage inadvertently reduced execution quality through less frequent validation and less comprehensive completion documentation.

The goal is to refine the Spec Planning Standards to restore incremental quality gates while maintaining reasonable token efficiency through a three-tier approach aligned with task complexity.

**Key Principles**:
- Validation depth should match task complexity and risk
- Completion documentation should be created for all subtasks with conditional detail levels
- Task type classification should be objective and determined during planning phase
- The system should be simple enough for AI agents to apply consistently

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Three-Tier Task Type Classification System

**User Story**: As a spec planner, I want a clear task type classification system, so that I can objectively categorize tasks during planning and apply appropriate validation and documentation standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a task list THEN the system SHALL support three task types: Setup, Implementation, and Architecture
2. WHEN a task is classified as Setup THEN it SHALL be defined as structural work (creating directories, configuring files, installing dependencies)
3. WHEN a task is classified as Implementation THEN it SHALL be defined as coding work (writing code, building features, implementing logic)
4. WHEN a task is classified as Architecture THEN it SHALL be defined as design work (making design decisions, creating algorithms, establishing patterns)
5. WHEN a task type is unclear THEN the AI agent SHALL prompt the human for clarification and document the decision
6. WHEN a new task pattern emerges THEN the definitions SHALL be updated to reflect the human-AI collaborative decision

### Requirement 2: Three-Tier Validation System

**User Story**: As a developer executing tasks, I want validation depth to match task complexity, so that errors are caught appropriately without excessive overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN completing a Setup task THEN the system SHALL apply **Tier 1: Minimal** validation including:
   - Run getDiagnostics to check for syntax and type errors
   - Verify all specified artifacts (files, directories) were created
   - Verify basic structure is correct and accessible
   
2. WHEN completing an Implementation task THEN the system SHALL apply **Tier 2: Standard** validation including:
   - Run getDiagnostics to check for syntax and type errors
   - Verify functional correctness (code executes as intended)
   - Verify integration with existing code (imports resolve, interfaces match)
   - Verify requirements compliance (all requirements for this task addressed)
   
3. WHEN completing an Architecture task OR a Parent task THEN the system SHALL apply **Tier 3: Comprehensive** validation including:
   - Run getDiagnostics to check for syntax and type errors
   - Verify functional correctness (code executes as intended)
   - Verify design soundness (architecture supports extensibility, separation of concerns maintained)
   - Verify integration with system (fits with overall architecture, interfaces clear)
   - Verify edge cases and error handling (handles invalid inputs, provides actionable errors)
   - Verify requirements compliance (all requirements for this task addressed)
   
4. WHEN completing a Parent task THEN the system SHALL apply Tier 3: Comprehensive validation (as defined in criterion 3) AND additionally include:
   - Verify all subtask validations passed
   - Verify each success criterion is met with evidence
   - Verify integration across all subtasks
   - Verify end-to-end functionality
   - Verify all requirements for parent task are covered
   
5. WHEN validation fails at any tier THEN errors SHALL be fixed before proceeding to the next task

6. WHEN validation passes THEN results SHALL be documented in the completion document with specific checks listed

### Requirement 3: Three-Tier Completion Documentation System

**User Story**: As a developer reviewing completed work, I want completion documentation for all subtasks with detail appropriate to task complexity, so that I can understand what was done and why without excessive documentation overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN completing any subtask THEN a completion document SHALL be created

2. WHEN completing a Setup task THEN the completion document SHALL use **Tier 1: Minimal** format including:
   - Artifacts Created (list of files/directories created)
   - Implementation Notes (brief description of what was done)
   - Validation section documenting Tier 1: Minimal validation results (as defined in Requirement 2.1)
   
3. WHEN completing an Implementation task THEN the completion document SHALL use **Tier 2: Standard** format including:
   - Artifacts Created (list of files/directories created)
   - Implementation Details (description of implementation approach and key decisions)
   - Validation section documenting Tier 2: Standard validation results (as defined in Requirement 2.2)
   - Requirements Compliance (which requirements were addressed)
   
4. WHEN completing an Architecture task OR a Parent task THEN the completion document SHALL use **Tier 3: Comprehensive** format including:
   - Artifacts Created (list of files/directories created)
   - Architecture Decisions (design decisions with options considered, rationale, trade-offs)
   - Implementation Details (description of implementation approach)
   - Algorithm section (if applicable - code examples, pseudocode)
   - Validation section documenting Tier 3: Comprehensive validation results (as defined in Requirement 2.3)
   - Requirements Compliance (which requirements were addressed)
   - Lessons Learned (insights from implementation)
   - Integration Points (how this integrates with other components)
   
5. WHEN completing a Parent task THEN the completion document SHALL use Tier 3: Comprehensive format (as defined in criterion 4) AND additionally include:
   - Success Criteria Verification section (each criterion verified with evidence)
   - Overall integration story (how subtasks fit together)
   - Validation section documenting Tier 3: Comprehensive validation plus success criteria checks (as defined in Requirement 2.4)
   
6. WHEN creating completion documents THEN each SHALL be a separate file named task-[N]-completion.md or task-[N.M]-completion.md

### Requirement 4: Task Type Metadata in Tasks Document

**User Story**: As an AI agent executing tasks, I want task type clearly specified in the tasks document, so that I know which validation and documentation tier to apply without ambiguity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a tasks.md document THEN each subtask SHALL include a Type metadata field
2. WHEN a subtask has Type: Setup THEN Minimal tier SHALL be applied
3. WHEN a subtask has Type: Implementation THEN Standard tier SHALL be applied
4. WHEN a subtask has Type: Architecture THEN Comprehensive tier SHALL be applied
5. WHEN a parent task is marked THEN it SHALL include Type: Parent and Comprehensive tier with success criteria SHALL be applied
6. WHEN task type is specified THEN validation level SHALL be explicitly documented in the task metadata

### Requirement 5: Updated Spec Planning Standards Document

### Requirement 7: Task Type Definitions Document
