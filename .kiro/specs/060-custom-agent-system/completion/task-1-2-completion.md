**Date**: 2026-02-14
**Organization**: spec-completion
**Scope**: 060-custom-agent-system
**Task**: 1.2 — Add frontmatter to component domain steering docs
**Status**: Complete

---

## Summary

All 7 component domain steering docs already had valid YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields added (likely during a prior session or as part of Task 1.1 execution). Verification confirmed all files meet the requirements.

## Files Verified

| File | name | description | inclusion: manual |
|------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| stemma-system-principles.md | Stemma-System-Principles | ✅ Present | ✅ Preserved |
| Component-Development-Standards.md | Component-Development-Standards | ✅ Present | ✅ Preserved |
| Component-Quick-Reference.md | Component-Quick-Reference | ✅ Present | ✅ Preserved |
| Component-Readiness-Status.md | Component-Readiness-Status | ✅ Present | ✅ Preserved |
| Component-Inheritance-Structures.md | Component-Inheritance-Structures | ✅ Present | ✅ Preserved |
| platform-implementation-guidelines.md | Platform-Implementation-Guidelines | ✅ Present | ✅ Preserved |
| Cross-Platform vs Platform-Specific Decision Framework.md | Cross-Platform-vs-Platform-Specific-Decision-Framework | ✅ Present | ✅ Preserved |

## Validation

- All frontmatter blocks are valid YAML with `---` delimiters
- Existing `inclusion: manual` field preserved in all files
- Document content below frontmatter unchanged
- Each description clearly indicates when the agent should load the full content
