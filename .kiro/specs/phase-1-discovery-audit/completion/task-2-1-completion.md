# Task 2.1 Completion: Review Release Management System

**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Task**: 2.1 Review release management system
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Complete
**Organization**: spec-completion
**Scope**: phase-1-discovery-audit

---

## Artifacts Created

- Updated `.kiro/audits/phase-1-issues-registry.md` with Issue #001
- This completion document

## Implementation Details

### Review Approach

Conducted systematic review of the release management system by examining:
1. Release manager hook implementation (`.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh`)
2. Release configuration (`.kiro/release-config.json`)
3. Agent hook configuration (`.kiro/agent-hooks/release-detection-on-task-completion.json`)
4. Execution history (`.kiro/logs/release-manager.log`)
5. Known issues documentation (`.kiro/issues/release-manager-taskstatus-trigger-issue.md`)
6. Manual trigger workaround testing

### Key Findings

**Release Manager Hook Implementation**:
- Well-structured bash script with comprehensive logging
- Supports multiple trigger modes: auto, commit, organize, manual
- Includes status command for system health checks
- Properly creates trigger files with metadata
- Attempts to process triggers with TypeScript release system

**Release Configuration**:
- Properly configured with detection enabled
- Monitors correct paths for completion documents
- Includes comprehensive versioning and publishing configuration
- Validation rules properly defined

**Agent Hook Configuration**:
- Correctly configured to trigger on `taskStatusChange` events
- Set to run after file organization hook
- Auto-approve enabled for seamless automation
- Configuration format appears correct

**Execution History**:
- Log shows successful detections for other specs (cross-platform-build-system, border-width-tokens, afternoon-to-dusk-rename)
- No entries for layering-token-system despite 20 completion documents
- Last entry from October 28, 18:03:55 (afternoon-to-dusk-rename)
- Pattern suggests hook triggers for some events but not taskStatus events

**Manual Trigger Workaround**:
- Status command works correctly
- Shows 8 pending triggers
- System components (npm, package.json) available
- Manual trigger would work but defeats automation purpose

### Issue Discovered

**Issue #001: Release Detection Hook Not Triggering on taskStatus Events**

**Severity**: Critical

**Summary**: The release detection agent hook does not execute when tasks are marked complete using the taskStatus tool, breaking the entire automated release detection workflow.

**Evidence**:
- 20 completion documents exist for layering-token-system
- No log entries in release manager log for this spec
- No trigger files created
- Release analyzer finds "0 completion documents"
- Manual trigger workaround required

**Root Cause Hypothesis**: The `taskStatusChange` event may not be emitting from the taskStatus tool, or the agent hook is not properly registered to receive these events. The hook chain dependency (runAfter: organize-after-task-completion) may also be a factor.

**Impact**: 
- Breaks automated release detection workflow
- Requires manual intervention for every task completion
- Defeats the purpose of the release management system
- Creates friction in development workflow

**Workaround**: Run `./.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto` manually after task completion.

### Testing Performed

1. **Status Check**: Verified release manager status shows system is configured correctly
2. **Log Review**: Confirmed no entries for recent taskStatus completions
3. **Trigger File Check**: Verified no trigger files created for layering-token-system
4. **Completion Document Count**: Confirmed 20 completion documents exist
5. **Configuration Review**: Verified all configuration files are correct
6. **Known Issue Review**: Confirmed issue is already documented in `.kiro/issues/`

## Validation (Tier 2: Standard)

### Syntax Validation
✅ All configuration files are valid JSON
✅ Bash script has no syntax errors
✅ Agent hook configuration follows correct schema

### Functional Validation
✅ Release manager hook executes successfully with manual trigger
✅ Status command provides accurate system information
✅ Configuration files are properly structured
❌ Automatic trigger on taskStatus events does not work (documented as Issue #001)

### Integration Validation
✅ Release manager integrates with TypeScript release system
✅ Trigger files are created with correct metadata format
✅ Log file is properly maintained
❌ Agent hook integration with taskStatus events is broken (documented as Issue #001)

### Requirements Compliance
✅ Requirement 1.1: Documented operational status of release management system
✅ Requirement 1.4: Documented issue with evidence and severity classification
✅ Requirement 1.5: Documented issue separately with reference to known issue
✅ Requirement 1.6: Issue documented in central registry with all required details
✅ Requirement 1.8: No fixes implemented, only documentation

## Requirements Addressed

- **Requirement 1.1**: Documented operational status of release management system including hook triggers, release detection, and version management
- **Requirement 1.4**: Documented issue with evidence (log files, configuration, reproduction steps), severity classification (Critical), and current workaround
- **Requirement 1.5**: Issue appears related to known issue in `.kiro/issues/release-manager-taskstatus-trigger-issue.md`, documented separately with reference and explanation of relationship
- **Requirement 1.6**: Issue documented in central registry at `.kiro/audits/phase-1-issues-registry.md` with complete details
- **Requirement 1.8**: No fixes or workarounds implemented, only documentation of findings

## Key Observations

### What Works

1. **Manual Trigger**: The release manager hook works correctly when triggered manually
2. **Configuration**: All configuration files are properly structured and valid
3. **Logging**: Logging system works correctly when hook executes
4. **Trigger Creation**: Trigger files are created with comprehensive metadata
5. **Status Reporting**: Status command provides useful system health information

### What Doesn't Work

1. **Automatic Trigger**: Hook does not execute on taskStatus events
2. **Event Propagation**: taskStatusChange events may not be emitting or reaching the hook
3. **Hook Chain**: Dependency on organize-after-task-completion may be blocking execution
4. **Completion Detection**: Release analyzer finds 0 documents despite documents existing

### System Health

**Positive Indicators**:
- Release configuration found and valid
- npm and package.json available
- 8 pending triggers (from other sources)
- Hook script is executable and functional
- TypeScript release system is available

**Negative Indicators**:
- No taskStatus event detections in log history
- No trigger files for recent taskStatus completions
- Hook chain dependency may be blocking execution
- Event emission or registration issue

## Related Documentation

- **Known Issue**: `.kiro/issues/release-manager-taskstatus-trigger-issue.md` - Detailed documentation of this issue with additional investigation notes
- **Release Config**: `.kiro/release-config.json` - Release detection configuration
- **Agent Hook Config**: `.kiro/agent-hooks/release-detection-on-task-completion.json` - Hook trigger configuration
- **Release Manager Hook**: `.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh` - Hook implementation
- **Development Workflow**: `.kiro/steering/Development Workflow.md` - Documents taskStatus tool usage and hook integration

## Next Steps

This task focused on discovery and documentation only. The issue has been documented in the central registry for future prioritization and fix implementation. The manual workaround allows continued development while the issue remains unfixed.

Future work should:
1. Investigate why taskStatusChange events don't trigger the hook
2. Test event emission from taskStatus tool
3. Verify agent hook registration with Kiro IDE
4. Consider alternative trigger mechanisms if event-based approach is not viable
5. Implement fix once root cause is identified
