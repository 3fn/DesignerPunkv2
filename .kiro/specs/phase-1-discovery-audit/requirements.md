# Requirements Document: Phase 1 Discovery Audit

**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Spec**: phase-1-discovery-audit
**Status**: Requirements Phase
**Dependencies**: None (audits completed Phase 1 specs)

---

## Introduction

The Phase 1 Discovery Audit systematically reviews all Phase 1 implementations to identify issues, inconsistencies, and gaps before proceeding to Phase 2 development. This audit follows a "report everything, fix nothing" approach - documenting all findings without implementing solutions.

Phase 1 encompasses the mathematical token foundation, cross-platform build system, semantic token generation, and all token type implementations completed to date. The audit validates that these foundations are solid before building Phase 2 features on top of them.

The audit produces four separate discovery documents, each focused on a specific domain: infrastructure, architecture, token system, and documentation. This separation allows focused review, flexible format per domain, and incremental progress.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Infrastructure Discovery Audit

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want a comprehensive audit of all infrastructure systems, so that I can identify automation failures and workflow issues before they block development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the infrastructure audit is conducted, THEN the audit SHALL document the operational status of the release management system including hook triggers, release detection, and version management

2. WHEN the infrastructure audit is conducted, THEN the audit SHALL document the operational status of the build system automation including task completion workflows, git integration, and commit hooks

3. WHEN the infrastructure audit is conducted, THEN the audit SHALL document the operational status of the file organization system including metadata-driven organization, cross-reference integrity, and agent hook execution

4. WHEN an infrastructure issue is discovered, THEN the audit SHALL document the issue with evidence, severity classification, and current workarounds if they exist

5. WHEN an infrastructure issue appears related to a known issue, THEN the audit SHALL document the issue separately with a reference to the known issue and explanation of the relationship

6. WHEN the infrastructure audit is complete, THEN the audit SHALL produce a discovery document at `.kiro/audits/phase-1-infrastructure-discovery.md` containing all findings

7. IF an infrastructure issue is already documented with identical details in `.kiro/issues/` or completion documents, THEN the audit SHALL reference the existing documentation rather than duplicate it

8. THE infrastructure audit SHALL NOT implement fixes, workarounds, or refactoring for any discovered issues

2. WHEN the architecture audit is conducted, THEN the audit SHALL document separation of concerns across all components including builders, validators, generators, and registries

3. WHEN the architecture audit is conducted, THEN the audit SHALL document interface contract definitions and their enforcement across all platform implementations

4. WHEN the architecture audit is conducted, THEN the audit SHALL document code organization consistency including file naming, directory structure, and module boundaries

5. WHEN an architectural inconsistency is discovered, THEN the audit SHALL document the inconsistency with evidence, severity classification, and comparison across platforms

6. WHEN an architectural issue appears related to a known issue, THEN the audit SHALL document the issue separately with a reference to the known issue and explanation of the relationship

7. WHEN the architecture audit is complete, THEN the audit SHALL produce a discovery document at `.kiro/audits/phase-1-architecture-discovery.md` containing all findings

8. IF an architectural issue is already documented with identical details in `.kiro/issues/` or completion documents, THEN the audit SHALL reference the existing documentation rather than duplicate it

9. THE architecture audit SHALL NOT implement fixes, refactoring, or pattern standardization for any discovered issues

---

### Requirement 3: Token System Discovery Audit

**User Story:** As a token system developer, I want a comprehensive audit of all token implementations, so that I can identify mathematical inconsistencies and validation gaps before building additional token types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the token system audit is conducted, THEN the audit SHALL document mathematical consistency across all token types including adherence to modular scale, baseline grid, and mathematical relationships

2. WHEN the token system audit is conducted, THEN the audit SHALL document primitiveâ†’semantic reference integrity across all semantic tokens including validation of reference chains and cross-platform consistency

3. WHEN the token system audit is conducted, THEN the audit SHALL document cross-platform generation accuracy for all token types including verification that generated output matches mathematical definitions

4. WHEN the token system audit is conducted, THEN the audit SHALL document validation system completeness including coverage of all token types and validation rules

5. WHEN a token system issue is discovered, THEN the audit SHALL document the issue with evidence, severity classification, and affected token types

6. WHEN a token system issue appears related to a known issue, THEN the audit SHALL document the issue separately with a reference to the known issue and explanation of the relationship

7. WHEN the token system audit is complete, THEN the audit SHALL produce a discovery document at `.kiro/audits/phase-1-token-system-discovery.md` containing all findings

8. IF a token system issue is already documented with identical details in `.kiro/issues/` or completion documents, THEN the audit SHALL reference the existing documentation rather than duplicate it

9. THE token system audit SHALL NOT implement fixes, validation updates, or token corrections for any discovered issues

---

### Requirement 4: Documentation Discovery Audit

**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want a comprehensive audit of all documentation, so that I can identify drift between documentation and implementation before it creates confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the documentation audit is conducted, THEN the audit SHALL document completion document accuracy by comparing completion docs to actual implementation for all Phase 1 specs

2. WHEN the documentation audit is conducted, THEN the audit SHALL document cross-reference integrity by verifying all links resolve correctly and bidirectional references are consistent

3. WHEN the documentation audit is conducted, THEN the audit SHALL document design decision documentation by verifying architectural decisions are captured with rationale and trade-offs

4. WHEN the documentation audit is conducted, THEN the audit SHALL document spec-to-implementation drift by identifying where design documents diverge from actual implementation

5. WHEN a documentation issue is discovered, THEN the audit SHALL document the issue with evidence, severity classification, and specific examples of drift or inaccuracy

6. WHEN a documentation issue appears related to a known issue, THEN the audit SHALL document the issue separately with a reference to the known issue and explanation of the relationship

7. WHEN the documentation audit is complete, THEN the audit SHALL produce a discovery document at `.kiro/audits/phase-1-documentation-discovery.md` containing all findings

8. IF a documentation issue is already documented with identical details in `.kiro/issues/` or completion documents, THEN the audit SHALL reference the existing documentation rather than duplicate it

9. THE documentation audit SHALL NOT implement fixes, updates, or corrections to any documentation for any discovered issues

## Audit Principles

### Report Everything, Fix Nothing

The discovery audit follows a strict separation between finding and fixing:

**Discovery Phase (This Spec):**
- Document all issues found
- Classify severity
- Provide evidence
- Note relationships to known issues
- Produce comprehensive findings documents

**Fix Phase (Future Specs):**
- Review all findings
- Prioritize based on severity and impact
- Create focused fix specs for critical issues
- Document remaining issues as technical debt

### No Filtering of Issues

The audit documents all discovered issues without filtering:

**Document all issues:**
- Regardless of perceived severity
- Regardless of relationship to known issues
- Regardless of whether they seem important

**Only skip documenting if:**
- Issue is already documented with identical details in `.kiro/issues/`
- Issue is already documented with identical details in completion documents
- In that case: reference existing documentation

**Rationale:** Complete picture prevents blind spots. Severity and importance are determined after seeing all findings, not during discovery.

### Severity Classification

All issues are classified by severity:

**Critical:**
- Blocks development or deployment
- Causes system failures or data loss
- Violates core architectural principles
- Affects multiple systems or platforms

**Important:**
- Reduces efficiency or reliability
- Creates technical debt
- Violates established patterns
- Affects single system or platform

**Minor:**
- Cosmetic or style issues
- Documentation inconsistencies
- Non-blocking improvements
- Isolated to specific component

### Evidence Requirements

All findings must include evidence:

**Required evidence:**
- Specific file paths and line numbers
- Code examples or configuration snippets
- Error messages or test failures
- Comparison across platforms (for architecture issues)
- Links to related documentation

**Evidence format:**
- Concrete and verifiable
- Sufficient for someone else to reproduce
- Clear connection between evidence and finding

## Success Criteria

The Phase 1 Discovery Audit is complete when:

1. âœ… All four discovery documents exist and are comprehensive
2. âœ… All Phase 1 specs have been reviewed systematically
3. âœ… All discovered issues are documented with evidence and severity
4. âœ… All relationships to known issues are noted
5. âœ… No fixes or solutions have been implemented
6. âœ… Clear decision point exists for next steps based on findings

---

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly out of scope for this audit:

- **Implementing fixes** for any discovered issues
- **Refactoring code** to address inconsistencies
- **Updating documentation** to match implementation
- **Creating new tests** to validate findings
- **Prioritizing fixes** beyond severity classification
- **Creating fix specs** for discovered issues
- **Making architectural decisions** about how to address issues

These activities will be addressed in future specs after reviewing all discovery findings.
