# Implementation Plan: Phase 1 Discovery Audit

**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Spec**: phase-1-discovery-audit
**Status**: Implementation Planning
**Dependencies**: None (audits completed Phase 1 specs)

---

## Implementation Plan

The Phase 1 Discovery Audit systematically reviews all Phase 1 implementations through four focused audits (infrastructure, architecture, token system, documentation), recording all findings in a centralized issues registry. Each audit produces an area-specific report that references issues in the registry, preventing duplication and enabling cross-area awareness.

The implementation follows a "report everything, fix nothing" approach - documenting all findings with reproduction steps and evidence without implementing solutions.
