# Design Document: Phase 1 Discovery Audit

**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Spec**: phase-1-discovery-audit
**Status**: Design Phase
**Dependencies**: None (audits completed Phase 1 specs)

---

## Overview

The Phase 1 Discovery Audit provides systematic review of all Phase 1 implementations to establish a complete, evidence-based picture of system health before proceeding to Phase 2 development. The audit follows a strict "report everything, fix nothing" approach, producing four focused discovery documents that comprehensively document findings without implementing solutions.

This design establishes the audit methodology, documentation format, severity classification system, and execution approach for each of the four discovery areas: infrastructure, architecture, token system, and documentation.

## Audit Methodology

### General Approach

**For Each Discovery Area:**

1. **Define Scope**: List all systems, specs, and files to review
2. **Systematic Review**: Review each item methodically
3. **Document Findings**: Record all issues with evidence
4. **Classify Severity**: Apply severity criteria consistently
5. **Check Known Issues**: Reference existing documentation
6. **Summarize Results**: Provide overview and recommendations

### Review Techniques

#### Code Review
- Read implementation files systematically
- Check for pattern consistency
- Verify against design documents
- Look for incomplete implementations
- Identify technical debt

#### Configuration Review
- Verify configuration files are complete
- Check for inconsistencies across environments
- Validate against documentation
- Test configuration loading

#### Documentation Review
- Compare documentation to implementation
- Check cross-reference integrity
- Verify design decisions are documented
- Identify drift between docs and code

#### Testing Review
- Check test coverage
- Verify tests actually test what they claim
- Look for skipped or disabled tests
- Validate test assertions

---

## Severity Classification System

### Critical Severity

**Definition**: Issues that block development, cause system failures, or violate core architectural principles.

**Criteria**:
- Prevents development or deployment
- Causes system crashes or data loss
- Breaks fundamental architectural patterns
- Affects multiple systems or platforms
- No workaround available

**Examples**:
- Release detection completely broken
- Build system fails for all platforms
- Core validation system non-functional
- Mathematical foundation violated across system

### Important Severity

**Definition**: Issues that reduce efficiency, create technical debt, or violate established patterns.

**Criteria**:
- Reduces development efficiency
- Creates maintenance burden
- Violates established patterns
- Affects single system or platform
- Workaround available but inconvenient

**Examples**:
- Platform implementation inconsistent with others
- Validation gaps for specific token types
- Documentation drift for major features
- Cross-reference integrity issues

### Minor Severity

**Definition**: Issues that are cosmetic, isolated, or have minimal impact.

**Criteria**:
- Cosmetic or style issues
- Documentation inconsistencies
- Non-blocking improvements
- Isolated to specific component
- Easy workaround available

**Examples**:
- Inconsistent file naming
- Missing inline comments
- Outdated examples in documentation
- Minor cross-reference issues

---

## Discovery Area Designs

### 1. Infrastructure Discovery

**Scope**:
- Release management system (`.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh`, `.kiro/release-config.json`)
- Build automation (task completion hooks, git workflow)
- File organization (metadata system, agent hooks)
- Agent hooks (`.kiro/agent-hooks/`)

**Review Process**:
1. Test each automation system manually
2. Review configuration files for completeness
3. Check hook execution logs
4. Verify integration between systems
5. Document what works, what doesn't, what's unclear

**Key Questions**:
- Does release detection trigger correctly?
- Do task completion hooks execute?
- Does file organization work as designed?
- Are agent hooks configured correctly?

---

### 2. Architecture Discovery

**Scope**:
- Platform implementations (iOS, Android, Web)
- Component separation (builders, validators, generators)
- Interface contracts (defined vs enforced)
- Code organization (file structure, naming)

**Review Process**:
1. Compare platform implementations side-by-side
2. Check separation of concerns in each component
3. Verify interface definitions exist and are enforced
4. Review file organization consistency
5. Document patterns and deviations

**Key Questions**:
- Do all platforms follow the same patterns?
- Is separation of concerns maintained?
- Are interface contracts enforced?
- Is code organization consistent?

**Comparison Matrix**:
```markdown
| Aspect | iOS | Android | Web | Consistent? |
|--------|-----|---------|-----|-------------|
| Builder pattern | [Details] | [Details] | [Details] | Yes/No |
| Validator pattern | [Details] | [Details] | [Details] | Yes/No |
| File structure | [Details] | [Details] | [Details] | Yes/No |
```

---

### 3. Token System Discovery

**Scope**:
- All token types (spacing, color, typography, borders, shadows, layering, etc.)
- Mathematical relationships (modular scale, baseline grid)
- Primitive→semantic references
- Cross-platform generation
- Validation system

**Review Process**:
1. List all token types implemented
2. Verify mathematical consistency for each type
3. Check primitive→semantic reference integrity
4. Test cross-platform generation for each type
5. Validate that validation system covers all types
6. Document gaps and inconsistencies

**Key Questions**:
- Do all tokens follow mathematical foundations?
- Are primitive→semantic references valid?
- Does generation work correctly for all platforms?
- Does validation cover all token types?

**Token Type Checklist**:
```markdown
- [ ] Spacing tokens
  - [ ] Mathematical consistency
  - [ ] Reference integrity
  - [ ] Generation accuracy
  - [ ] Validation coverage
- [ ] Color tokens
  - [ ] Mathematical consistency
  - [ ] Reference integrity
  - [ ] Generation accuracy
  - [ ] Validation coverage
[... repeat for all token types]
```

---

### 4. Documentation Discovery

**Scope**:
- All Phase 1 spec documents (requirements, design, tasks)
- All completion documents
- Cross-references throughout documentation
- Design decision documentation

**Review Process**:
1. For each spec, compare design to implementation
2. For each completion doc, verify accuracy
3. Test all cross-reference links
4. Check that design decisions are documented
5. Document drift and inaccuracies

**Key Questions**:
- Do completion docs match actual implementation?
- Do all cross-references resolve correctly?
- Are design decisions documented with rationale?
- Where has documentation drifted from implementation?

**Drift Detection**:
```markdown
### Spec: [spec-name]

**Design Document Claims**:
- [What design doc says]

**Actual Implementation**:
- [What code actually does]

**Drift Assessment**:
- [Description of difference and impact]
```

---

## Known Issue Handling

### Checking for Known Issues

Before documenting a new finding, check:
1. `.kiro/issues/` directory for documented issues
2. Completion documents for mentioned issues
3. Design documents for documented limitations

### Documenting Related Issues

When a finding appears related to a known issue:

```markdown
### Finding [N]: [New Issue Title]

**Severity**: [Severity]
**Status**: Related to Known Issue

**Description**:
[Full description of what was found]

**Evidence**:
[Specific evidence]

**Relationship to Known Issue**:
This appears related to [known issue reference] because [explain connection].

However, documenting separately because:
- [Reason 1: e.g., affects different system]
- [Reason 2: e.g., different symptoms]
- [Reason 3: e.g., additional context]

**Related Issues**:
- `.kiro/issues/release-manager-taskstatus-trigger-issue.md`
```

### Referencing Existing Documentation

When a finding is already documented with identical details:

```markdown
### Finding [N]: [Issue Title]

**Severity**: [Severity]
**Status**: Already Documented

**Reference**: `.kiro/issues/[issue-file].md`

**Additional Context** (if any):
[Any new context or evidence not in original documentation]
```

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Separate Documents per Area

**Options Considered**:
1. Single comprehensive audit document
2. Separate document per area (chosen)
3. Separate document per spec reviewed

**Decision**: Separate document per discovery area (4 documents total)

**Rationale**:
- **Focused scope**: Each document has clear boundaries
- **Parallel execution**: Different areas can be audited independently
- **Format flexibility**: Each area can use format that fits its domain
- **Incremental progress**: Complete one area, move to next
- **AI agent execution**: Easier for AI agents to complete focused tasks

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Clear scope, parallel execution, format flexibility
- ❌ **Lost**: Single comprehensive view (mitigated by summary document)
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Cross-area issues might be documented multiple times

### Decision 2: Report Everything, Fix Nothing

**Options Considered**:
1. Discover and fix issues immediately
2. Discover issues, prioritize, then fix critical ones
3. Discover all issues, fix nothing (chosen)

**Decision**: Report everything, fix nothing during discovery phase

**Rationale**:
- **Complete picture**: See all issues before deciding what to fix
- **Prevents premature optimization**: Don't fix minor issues before seeing critical ones
- **Evidence-based prioritization**: Prioritize based on complete findings, not first impressions
- **Scope control**: Discovery phase stays focused on finding, not fixing
- **Better decision making**: Fix decisions made with full context

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Complete picture, better prioritization, scope control
- ❌ **Lost**: Immediate fixes for obvious issues
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Discipline required to not fix issues during discovery

### Decision 3: Severity Classification System

**Options Considered**:
1. Binary (Blocking / Non-blocking)
2. Three-tier (Critical / Important / Minor) - chosen
3. Five-tier (Critical / High / Medium / Low / Trivial)

**Decision**: Three-tier severity classification

**Rationale**:
- **Sufficient granularity**: Three tiers provide enough distinction without over-complicating
- **Clear criteria**: Easy to classify issues consistently
- **Actionable**: Clear what needs immediate attention vs what can wait
- **Not over-engineered**: Five tiers would create false precision

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Gained**: Clear classification, actionable priorities, simple system
- ❌ **Lost**: Fine-grained prioritization within tiers
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Some issues might be borderline between tiers

---

## Testing Strategy

### Discovery Audit Validation

**How to validate the audit is complete**:

1. **Scope Coverage**: All systems/specs/files in scope were reviewed
2. **Evidence Quality**: All findings have specific, verifiable evidence
3. **Severity Consistency**: Severity classifications follow defined criteria
4. **Known Issue Check**: All findings checked against known issues
5. **Documentation Quality**: Findings are clear and actionable

### Self-Validation Checklist

For each discovery document:

```markdown
- [ ] All items in scope were reviewed
- [ ] All findings have specific evidence (file paths, line numbers, snippets)
- [ ] All findings have severity classification with rationale
- [ ] All findings checked against known issues
- [ ] Summary section provides accurate counts
- [ ] Recommendations section provides next-step guidance
- [ ] Document follows standard format
- [ ] No fixes were implemented during discovery
```

## Integration Points

### Input Dependencies

**Existing Documentation**:
- All Phase 1 spec documents (requirements, design, tasks)
- All completion documents
- Known issues in `.kiro/issues/`
- Design decision documentation

**Existing Code**:
- All Phase 1 implementations
- Configuration files
- Test files
- Build scripts and hooks

### Output Artifacts

**Centralized Issues Registry**:
- `.kiro/audits/phase-1-issues-registry.md` - All discovered issues with full details

**Area-Specific Reports**:
- `.kiro/audits/phase-1-infrastructure-report.md`
- `.kiro/audits/phase-1-architecture-report.md`
- `.kiro/audits/phase-1-token-system-report.md`
- `.kiro/audits/phase-1-documentation-report.md`

**Metadata**:
- **Organization**: `audit-findings`
- **Scope**: `phase-1-discovery-audit`

### Downstream Usage

**Fix Prioritization**:
- Review all findings across all areas
- Prioritize based on severity and impact
- Create focused fix specs for critical issues
- Document remaining issues as technical debt

**Phase 2 Planning**:
- Use findings to inform Phase 2 approach
- Ensure Phase 2 doesn't build on broken foundations
- Incorporate lessons learned into Phase 2 design

---

## Execution Approach

### Sequential Execution

**Recommended order**:
1. Infrastructure Discovery (foundation systems)
2. Architecture Discovery (code patterns)
3. Token System Discovery (domain logic)
4. Documentation Discovery (documentation accuracy)

**Rationale**: Infrastructure issues might explain architecture issues, architecture issues might explain token system issues, etc. Sequential execution allows each audit to inform the next.

### Parallel Execution (Alternative)

If time is critical, areas can be audited in parallel since they have independent scopes. However, cross-area issues might be documented multiple times.

### Incremental Review

After each discovery document is complete:
1. Review findings with human
2. Clarify any ambiguous findings
3. Decide whether to continue to next area or pause
4. Adjust approach for remaining areas based on learnings

---

## Success Criteria

The Phase 1 Discovery Audit design is successful when:

1. ✅ Clear methodology for each discovery area
2. ✅ Consistent documentation format across all areas
3. ✅ Objective severity classification system
4. ✅ Process for handling known issues
5. ✅ Validation approach for audit completeness
6. ✅ Integration with downstream fix prioritization

---

*This design document establishes the methodology and format for the Phase 1 Discovery Audit, ensuring comprehensive, evidence-based findings that enable informed decision-making about fixes and Phase 2 planning.*
