**Date**: February 20, 2026
**Task**: Task 6 — Documentation (Parent)
**Type**: Documentation (Parent)
**Validation**: Tier 2 - Standard
**Organization**: spec-completion
**Scope**: 054b-figma-design-extract

## Summary

Created comprehensive developer-facing documentation for the Figma extraction workflow (Spec 054b), including a new Figma Workflow Guide covering both push and extraction workflows, an annotated example design-outline.md, and updates to the DTCG Integration Guide.

## Success Criteria Verification

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Figma Workflow Guide created covering both push and extraction workflows | ✅ |
| Figma-specific content migrated from DTCG Integration Guide | ✅ |
| Design-to-spec-to-code workflow documented with scope clarity | ✅ |
| Confidence flags and troubleshooting documented | ✅ |
| All cross-references to related documentation included | ✅ |

## Primary Artifacts

| Artifact | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Figma Workflow Guide | `docs/figma-workflow-guide.md` | Comprehensive guide for both push and extraction workflows |
| DTCG Integration Guide | `docs/dtcg-integration-guide.md` | Updated with cross-references, Figma content migrated out |
| Annotated Example | `docs/examples/design-outline-example.md` | Reference example with annotations for every section |

## Subtask Completion

| Subtask | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| 6.1 | Create Figma Workflow Guide | ✅ Complete |
| 6.2 | Migrate Figma-specific content from DTCG Integration Guide | ✅ Complete |
| 6.3 | Document design-to-spec-to-code workflow | ✅ Complete |
| 6.4 | Document confidence flags and interpretation | ✅ Complete |
| 6.5 | Create annotated example design-outline.md | ✅ Complete |

## Figma Workflow Guide Structure

The guide covers:

1. **Overview** — Bidirectional integration, prerequisites
2. **MCP Setup** — figma-console-mcp, Kiro Figma Power, Desktop Bridge, authentication
3. **Token Push Workflow** — CLI usage, drift detection, partial failure/resume, troubleshooting
4. **Design Extraction Workflow** — Design-to-spec-to-code diagram, CLI usage, extraction pipeline, confidence flag interpretation (with per-token and overall flag tables, tolerance rules, examples for each flag level), token translation, design outline sections, component token suggestions, mode validation
5. **Annotated Example** — Reference link to `docs/examples/design-outline-example.md`
6. **Troubleshooting** — MCP connection, Desktop Bridge, authentication, no-match values, missing Component-Family docs, DTCG file not found
7. **Related Documentation** — Cross-references to DTCG guide, Token Governance, Component Development Guide, Spec Planning Standards, Token System Overview, Spec 054a/054b designs

## Annotated Example Coverage

The example (`docs/examples/design-outline-example.md`) demonstrates a `ButtonCTA` extraction with:

- All 13+ sections generated by `generateDesignOutlineMarkdown()`
- HTML comment annotations explaining each section's purpose
- ✅, ⚠️, and ❌ confidence flags shown in context with explanations
- Binding vs value match methods demonstrated
- Illustrative component token suggestions with "pending Ada review" labels
- Mode validation categorization (expected vs unexpected discrepancies)
- Conditional section format (Unmatched Values) shown in annotation
- Variant mapping recommendations with conflict format

## Requirements Compliance

- **Req 11**: All acceptance criteria met — documentation at `docs/figma-workflow-guide.md`, Figma content migrated from DTCG guide, push and extraction workflows documented, confidence flag interpretation guide, troubleshooting section, annotated example, cross-references included
