# Task 6.5 Completion: Create Annotated Example design-outline.md

**Date**: February 20, 2026
**Task**: 6.5 Create annotated example design-outline.md
**Type**: Documentation
**Validation**: Tier 2 - Standard
**Organization**: spec-completion
**Scope**: 054b-figma-design-extract

---

## What Was Done

Created `docs/examples/design-outline-example.md` — a complete annotated example showing every section the DesignExtractor generates for a `ButtonCTA` component. Added a reference to it from the Figma Workflow Guide.

## Artifacts Created

- `docs/examples/design-outline-example.md` — Annotated example design outline
- `docs/figma-workflow-guide.md` — Updated with reference to the example

## Sections Covered

The example includes all sections generated by `generateDesignOutlineMarkdown()`:

1. **Component Purpose** — Name, description, properties
2. **Variants** — Variant table with mapping recommendations (including ⚠️ conflict example format)
3. **States** — Visual states list
4. **Token Usage** — All five categories (spacing, colors, typography, radius, shadows) with ✅, ⚠️, and binding/value method examples
5. **Accessibility** — Interactive component considerations
6. **Platform Behaviors** — Platform-specific interaction table
7. **Edge Cases** — Aggregated flagged issues
8. **Extraction Confidence** — Overall summary with counts and review items
9. **Inheritance Pattern** — Component-Family alignment (with note on missing-doc format)
10. **Behavioral Contracts** — Interactive classification with contract status
11. **Platform Parity** — Platform-specific concerns
12. **Component Token Needs** — Two illustrative suggestion patterns with "pending Ada review" labels
13. **Accessibility Contracts** — Checklist with detected/review statuses
14. **Unmatched Values** — Conditional section format shown in annotation
15. **Mode Validation** — Categorization explanation (expected vs unexpected discrepancies)

## Annotation Approach

Annotations use HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) so they don't interfere with rendered markdown. Each section has a comment block explaining:
- The section's purpose
- How confidence flags apply
- What actions are required for each flag level
- How the data was extracted (binding vs value, heuristics, MCP queries)

## Requirements Compliance

- **Req 11**: Example design-outline.md with annotations explaining each section and confidence flag usage ✅
