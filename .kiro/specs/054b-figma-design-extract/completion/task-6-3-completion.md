# Task 6.3 Completion: Document design-to-spec-to-code workflow

**Date**: February 20, 2026
**Task**: 6.3 Document design-to-spec-to-code workflow
**Spec**: 054b - Figma Design Extraction
**Organization**: spec-completion
**Scope**: 054b-figma-design-extract

## Summary

Enhanced the Design-to-Spec-to-Code Workflow subsection in `docs/figma-workflow-guide.md` to fully satisfy Requirement 11's workflow documentation criteria.

## Changes Made

**File**: `docs/figma-workflow-guide.md` — Design Extraction Workflow section

- Added explicit scope note: "This spec (054b) implements Phase 2 only"
- Marked Phase 2 as "THIS SPEC (054b)" in the diagram
- Marked Phases 3, 4, and 5 with "out of scope" labels in the diagram
- Added cross-reference to existing DesignerPunk processes for Phases 3–5
- Added "Critical distinction" callout explaining extraction surfaces information while humans make decisions
- Expanded the distinction with three concrete examples showing what extraction surfaces vs who decides (Ada, Lina, Thurgood)

## Validation

- All six task checklist items addressed
- Content aligns with requirements.md Requirement 11 and the design-to-spec-to-code workflow described in the Introduction section of requirements.md
- Consistent with design.md's architecture documentation
