## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Approach
- **Isolation**: Each security component tested independently
- **Coverage**: All public methods and configuration options tested
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios validated
- **Integration**: Cross-component interactions verified

### Test Organization
- **Descriptive Suites**: Tests grouped by functionality
- **Clear Assertions**: Each test validates specific behavior
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All success criteria met
- **Maintainability**: Tests follow consistent patterns

### Validation Methodology
- **Positive Tests**: Verify expected behavior works correctly
- **Negative Tests**: Verify restrictions and blocks work as intended
- **Configuration Tests**: Verify dynamic configuration updates
- **Integration Tests**: Verify components work together correctly

## Key Testing Insights

### AI Agent Restriction Testing
1. **Human vs AI Context**: Tests validate different behavior for human and AI agent actions
2. **Strategic Flexibility**: Existing tokens allowed, new tokens blocked with alternatives
3. **Approval Workflow**: Human approval requests created with justification and alternatives
4. **Statistics Tracking**: Block rates and approval requirements tracked accurately

### Contamination Prevention Testing
1. **Multi-Pattern Detection**: Code blocks, inline code, and implementation patterns detected
2. **Severity Assignment**: Critical for documentation, high for code, medium for language
3. **Context Awareness**: Severity adjusted based on content context
4. **Configuration Flexibility**: Individual detection types can be enabled/disabled

### Integration Testing
1. **End-to-End Workflow**: Complete security workflow validated from restriction to approval
2. **Multi-Layer Prevention**: Contamination prevented through multiple security layers
3. **Audit Reporting**: Comprehensive audit reports with recommendations generated
4. **Configuration Coordination**: Configuration updates propagate across security systems
