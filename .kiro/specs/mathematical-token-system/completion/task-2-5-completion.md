# Task 2.5 Completion: Unit Tests for Typography Token Families

**Date**: 2025-01-10  
**Purpose**: Completion documentation for typography token family unit tests  
**Organization**: spec-completion  
**Scope**: mathematical-token-system  
**Task**: 2.5 Write unit tests for typography token families

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive unit tests for all typography token families with 122 passing tests across 4 test suites. The implementation provides thorough validation of font family, font weight, and letter spacing tokens with complete coverage of their mathematical relationships, platform consistency, and integration with the token system.

## Artifacts Created

### Primary Test Files
- **`src/tokens/__tests__/FontFamilyTokens.test.ts`** - 36 tests covering font family token categorical values and platform consistency
- **`src/tokens/__tests__/FontWeightTokens.test.ts`** - 42 tests covering font weight token numeric progression and mathematical relationships  
- **`src/tokens/__tests__/LetterSpacingTokens.test.ts`** - 35 tests covering letter spacing token precision targeting and em-based values

### Integration Tests
- **Updated `src/tokens/__tests__/TokenCategories.test.ts`** - Added 9 new integration tests for typography token families

## Typography Token Testing Strategy

### Categorical vs Numeric Token Validation

**Font Family Tokens (Categorical)**
- Validated categorical nature with appropriate base values (0 for non-mathematical tokens)
- Tested font stack definitions and cross-platform consistency
- Verified platform-appropriate font fallbacks and modern font prioritization
- Confirmed identical font stacks across all platforms with `fontFamily` unit type

**Font Weight Tokens (Numeric)**
- Validated complete 100-900 weight range following CSS standards
- Tested mathematical progression from base 400 with proportional relationships
- Verified standard font weight terminology and semantic descriptions
- Confirmed numeric consistency across platforms with `fontWeight` unit type

**Letter Spacing Tokens (Precision-Targeted)**
- Validated em-based values for scalable typography refinement
- Tested symmetric progression around base value 0 with fine-grained adjustments
- Verified precision targeting flags for typography control
- Confirmed relative em units across platforms for scalability

### Test Case Rationale

**Mathematical Relationship Testing**
- Font family tokens: Verified "N/A - Categorical value" for non-mathematical tokens
- Font weight tokens: Validated proportional relationships from base 400 (e.g., 100 = 400 × 0.25)
- Letter spacing tokens: Tested additive/subtractive relationships from base 0 (e.g., -0.025 = 0 - 0.025)

**Platform Consistency Validation**
- All typography tokens maintain identical values across web, iOS, and Android platforms
- Unit types are consistent and appropriate for each token category
- Cross-platform compatibility ensures True Native design system principles

**Integration Testing Approach**
- Verified token category assignments match expected TokenCategory enum values
- Tested family base value consistency within each typography token family
- Validated precision targeting flags align with typography refinement needs
- Confirmed token retrieval functions work correctly for all typography categories
