## Introduction

The Mathematical Token System serves as the foundational layer for the DesignerPunk Design System, providing mathematical consistency across web, iOS, and Android platforms. This system implements the Token Architecture 2.0 mathematics with strategic flexibility tokens while maintaining cross-platform mathematical relationships. The system operates as a remote worker with specialized expertise serving multiple markets (platforms) through translation services, following the business localization model established in the strategic framework.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Cross-Platform Mathematical Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer using the DesignerPunk Design System, I want mathematical relationships to be consistent across web, iOS, and Android platforms, so that I can confidently build components knowing they will behave predictably regardless of platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a primitive or semantic token is defined THEN the system SHALL generate mathematically equivalent values for web (REM), iOS (points), and Android (dp)
2. WHEN mathematical relationships are established THEN the system SHALL maintain proportional consistency across all three platforms
3. WHEN baseline grid calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL produce near identical visual results across web, iOS, and Android
4. IF platform-specific mathematical constraints exist THEN the system SHALL document the constraint and provide the closest mathematically valid alternative
5. WHEN cross-platform validation is performed THEN the system SHALL verify mathematical consistency within acceptable tolerance levels

### Requirement 2: Strategic Flexibility Token Implementation

**User Story:** As a design system architect, I want strategic flexibility tokens (6px, 10px, 20px) to be available for exceptional cases, so that the system can handle edge cases without breaking mathematical consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN strategic flexibility tokens are used THEN the system SHALL treat them as Pass-level validation without warnings
2. WHEN strategic flexibility usage is analyzed THEN the system SHALL track usage patterns to ensure â‰¥80% appropriate usage
3. IF strategic flexibility tokens are overused THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on semantic token alternatives
4. WHEN strategic flexibility tokens are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain cross-platform mathematical relationships
5. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL distinguish between strategic flexibility usage and mathematical errors
6. WHEN an AI Agent wants to add a new strategic flexibility token THEN the AI Agent must seek approval from a Human to do so

### Requirement 3: Three-Tier Validation System

**User Story:** As a developer using design tokens, I want clear validation feedback about my token usage, so that I can understand when I'm following best practices, when I need to be cautious, and when I'm making errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token usage follows semantic patterns THEN the system SHALL provide Pass validation with no warnings
2. WHEN token usage is mathematically valid but potentially problematic THEN the system SHALL provide Warning validation with guidance
3. WHEN token usage violates mathematical relationships THEN the system SHALL provide Error validation with correction suggestions
4. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL provide clear rationale for each validation level
5. WHEN developers request validation details THEN the system SHALL explain the mathematical reasoning behind the validation result

### Requirement 4: Translation Provider Architecture

**User Story:** As a build system integrator, I want platform-specific token constants generated automatically, so that I can package the appropriate token files with components without manual token management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN semantic tokens are defined THEN the Translation Providers SHALL generate platform-specific constant files (DesignTokens.web.js, DesignTokens.ios.swift, DesignTokens.android.kt)
2. WHEN Unit Providers process tokens THEN they SHALL convert semantic values to appropriate platform units (REM, points, dp)
3. WHEN Format Providers process tokens THEN they SHALL generate platform-appropriate syntax and naming conventions
4. WHEN Path Providers process tokens THEN they SHALL organize tokens into platform-appropriate file structures
5. WHEN token generation is complete THEN the system SHALL validate that all platform files contain mathematically consistent values

### Requirement 5: Primitive and Semantic Token Composition Patterns

**User Story:** As a component developer, I want clear primitive and semantic token usage patterns, so that I can compose tokens appropriately without creating mathematical inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing tokens THEN prioritize using semantic tokens if available before opting to use primitive tokens as a fallback
2. WHEN components use spacing tokens THEN they SHALL compose primitive and/or semantic tokens (space075, space100, space150) rather than raw values
3. WHEN components use sizing tokens THEN they SHALL follow primitive and/or semantic sizing patterns (size275, size300, size400) for consistent proportions
4. WHEN components use radius tokens THEN they SHALL apply primitive and/or semantic radius values (radius100, radius200) that maintain mathematical relationships
5. IF components require non-semantic values THEN they SHALL use strategic flexibility tokens with appropriate justification
6. WHEN token composition is validated THEN the system SHALL verify primitive and/or semantic token usage follows established patterns

### Requirement 6: Mathematical Foundation Integration

**User Story:** As a design system architect, I want the token system to integrate with the mathematical foundation from Token Architecture 2.0, so that all design decisions follow predictable mathematical relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modular scale is applied THEN the system SHALL generate token values following the established mathematical progression
2. WHEN baseline grid calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL ensure all tokens align with the grid system
3. WHEN mathematical relationships are established THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with the REM and baseline grid structure
4. IF mathematical conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL prioritize mathematical consistency over arbitrary design preferences
5. WHEN mathematical validation is performed THEN the system SHALL verify all tokens follow the established mathematical foundation

### Requirement 7: Contamination Prevention Integration

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want the token system to prevent contamination vectors, so that AI systems cannot learn patterns that would degrade the mathematical consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token documentation is created THEN it SHALL follow concept-based approach without code examples that could contaminate AI training
2. WHEN token generation processes are documented THEN they SHALL avoid implementation details that could create contamination vectors
3. WHEN AI agents interact with the token system THEN they SHALL be restricted from creating unauthorized flexibility tokens
4. IF contamination risks are identified THEN the system SHALL implement process-based controls to prevent contamination
5. WHEN contamination auditing is performed THEN the system SHALL validate that no contamination vectors have been introduced

### Requirement 8: Performance and Integration Requirements

**User Story:** As a developer integrating the token system, I want the system to perform efficiently and integrate seamlessly with build processes, so that token usage doesn't create performance bottlenecks or integration complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token constants are generated THEN the process SHALL complete in <5ms for typical token sets
2. WHEN platform-specific files are created THEN they SHALL be optimized for platform-appropriate bundling and tree-shaking
3. WHEN build systems integrate token files THEN they SHALL be able to select appropriate platform files without coordination complexity
4. IF token generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
5. WHEN performance is measured THEN the system SHALL demonstrate no significant impact on build times or runtime performance
