## Introduction

The Mathematical Token System serves as the foundational layer for the DesignerPunk Design System, providing mathematical consistency across web, iOS, and Android platforms. This system implements the Token Architecture 2.0 mathematics with strategic flexibility tokens while maintaining cross-platform mathematical relationships. The system operates as a remote worker with specialized expertise serving multiple markets (platforms) through translation services, following the business localization model established in the strategic framework.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Cross-Platform Mathematical Consistency with Unitless Values

**User Story:** As a developer using the DesignerPunk Design System, I want mathematical relationships to be consistent across web, iOS, and Android platforms using unitless token values, so that I can confidently build components knowing they will behave predictably regardless of platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a primitive or semantic token is defined THEN the system SHALL store unitless values and generate platform-specific units during translation (web: px/REM, iOS: points, Android: dp/sp)
2. WHEN mathematical relationships are established THEN the system SHALL maintain proportional consistency across all three platforms using per-family base values
3. WHEN baseline grid calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL produce near identical visual results across web, iOS, and Android
4. IF platform-specific mathematical constraints exist THEN the system SHALL document the constraint and provide the closest mathematically valid alternative
5. WHEN cross-platform validation is performed THEN the system SHALL verify mathematical consistency within acceptable tolerance levels

### Requirement 2: Strategic Flexibility Token Implementation

**User Story:** As a design system architect, I want strategic flexibility tokens to be available for exceptional cases within each token family, so that the system can handle edge cases without breaking mathematical consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN strategic flexibility tokens are used THEN the system SHALL treat them as Pass-level validation without warnings
2. WHEN strategic flexibility tokens are defined THEN they SHALL be mathematically derived but break the systematic progression within their token family (e.g., space075 = space100 × 0.75 = 6)
3. WHEN strategic flexibility usage is analyzed THEN the system SHALL track usage patterns to ensure ≥80% appropriate usage
4. IF strategic flexibility tokens are overused THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on semantic token alternatives
5. WHEN strategic flexibility tokens are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain cross-platform mathematical relationships
6. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL distinguish between strategic flexibility usage and mathematical errors
7. WHEN an AI Agent wants to add a new strategic flexibility token THEN the AI Agent must seek approval from a Human to do so

### Requirement 3: Three-Tier Validation System

**User Story:** As a developer using design tokens, I want clear validation feedback about my token usage, so that I can understand when I'm following best practices, when I need to be cautious, and when I'm making errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token usage follows semantic patterns THEN the system SHALL provide Pass validation with no warnings
2. WHEN token usage is mathematically valid but potentially problematic THEN the system SHALL provide Warning validation with guidance
3. WHEN token usage violates mathematical relationships THEN the system SHALL provide Error validation with correction suggestions
4. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL provide clear rationale for each validation level
5. WHEN developers request validation details THEN the system SHALL explain the mathematical reasoning behind the validation result

### Requirement 4: Translation Provider Architecture

**User Story:** As a build system integrator, I want platform-specific token constants generated automatically, so that I can package the appropriate token files with components without manual token management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN semantic tokens are defined THEN the Translation Providers SHALL generate platform-specific constant files (DesignTokens.web.js, DesignTokens.ios.swift, DesignTokens.android.kt)
2. WHEN Unit Providers process tokens THEN they SHALL convert semantic values to appropriate platform units (REM, points, dp)
3. WHEN Format Providers process tokens THEN they SHALL generate platform-appropriate syntax and naming conventions
4. WHEN Path Providers process tokens THEN they SHALL organize tokens into platform-appropriate file structures
5. WHEN token generation is complete THEN the system SHALL validate that all platform files contain mathematically consistent values

### Requirement 5: Multi-Family Token System Implementation

**User Story:** As a component developer, I want access to multiple token families (spacing, typography, line height, radius, density, tap area) with clear usage patterns, so that I can compose tokens appropriately without creating mathematical inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing tokens THEN prioritize using semantic tokens if available before opting to use primitive tokens as a fallback
2. WHEN components use spacing tokens THEN they SHALL use tokens from the spacing family (space050, space100, space150) with base value 8
3. WHEN components use semantic spacing for layout THEN they SHALL use hierarchical layout tokens (space.grouped.*, space.related.*, space.separated.*, space.sectioned.*) based on relationship between elements
4. WHEN components use semantic spacing for padding THEN they SHALL use inset tokens (space.inset.*) based on desired interface density
5. WHEN zero spacing is needed THEN developers SHALL use 0 directly rather than a token (zero represents absence of spacing, not a spacing value)
6. WHEN components use typography tokens THEN they SHALL use tokens from the fontSize family (fontSize100, fontSize125, fontSize150) with base value 16
7. WHEN components use line height THEN they SHALL use paired lineHeight tokens with corresponding fontSize tokens (fontSize050 with lineHeight050, fontSize100 with lineHeight100, etc.) where lineHeight multipliers are calculated to achieve 4pt subgrid alignment
8. WHEN components use border radius THEN they SHALL use tokens from the radius family (radius100, radius200) with base value 8
9. WHEN density scaling is applied THEN it SHALL multiply functional tokens (spacing, typography, tap areas) but NOT aesthetic tokens (radius, line height ratios)
10. WHEN accessibility requirements apply THEN components SHALL use tapArea tokens (tapAreaMinimum, tapAreaRecommended) with base value 44
11. WHEN token composition is validated THEN the system SHALL verify primitive and/or semantic token usage follows established per-family patterns

### Requirement 6: Per-Family Mathematical Foundation Integration

**User Story:** As a design system architect, I want the token system to use per-family base values with precision targeting, so that all design decisions follow predictable mathematical relationships while achieving systematic alignment goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token families are defined THEN each family SHALL have its own base value (spacing: 8, typography: 16, lineHeight: 1.5, radius: 8, density: 1.0, tapArea: 44)
2. WHEN modular scale is applied to typography THEN the system SHALL use 1.125 ratio (musical fourth) for systematic font size progression
3. WHEN line height tokens are calculated THEN they SHALL use precision multipliers to align with 4pt typography subgrid when combined with their paired fontSize tokens, achieving systematic vertical rhythm
4. WHEN fontSize and lineHeight tokens are paired THEN they SHALL follow exact coupling (fontSize050↔lineHeight050, fontSize100↔lineHeight100, etc.) with multipliers rounded to thousandths
5. WHEN line height multipliers are calculated THEN they SHALL produce tighter ratios as font size increases (body text: 1.5-1.556, headers: 1.143-1.4) to maintain appropriate visual hierarchy
6. WHEN tap area tokens are calculated THEN they SHALL use precision multipliers to achieve specific accessibility targets at default scale
7. WHEN baseline grid calculations are performed THEN spacing and radius tokens SHALL align with 8-unit grid system
8. WHEN typography vertical rhythm is calculated THEN line heights SHALL align to 4pt subgrid (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, etc.)
9. IF mathematical conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL prioritize mathematical consistency over arbitrary design preferences
10. WHEN mathematical validation is performed THEN the system SHALL verify all tokens follow their family's mathematical foundation

### Requirement 7: Contamination Prevention Integration

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want the token system to prevent contamination vectors, so that AI systems cannot learn patterns that would degrade the mathematical consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token documentation is created THEN it SHALL follow concept-based approach without code examples that could contaminate AI training
2. WHEN token generation processes are documented THEN they SHALL avoid implementation details that could create contamination vectors
3. WHEN AI agents interact with the token system THEN they SHALL be restricted from creating unauthorized flexibility tokens
4. IF contamination risks are identified THEN the system SHALL implement process-based controls to prevent contamination
5. WHEN contamination auditing is performed THEN the system SHALL validate that no contamination vectors have been introduced

### Requirement 8: Performance and Integration Requirements

**User Story:** As a developer integrating the token system, I want the system to perform efficiently and integrate seamlessly with build processes, so that token usage doesn't create performance bottlenecks or integration complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token constants are generated THEN the process SHALL complete in <5ms for typical token sets
2. WHEN platform-specific files are created THEN they SHALL be optimized for platform-appropriate bundling and tree-shaking
3. WHEN build systems integrate token files THEN they SHALL be able to select appropriate platform files without coordination complexity
4. IF token generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
5. WHEN performance is measured THEN the system SHALL demonstrate no significant impact on build times or runtime performance
