# Issue: Release Manager Not Detecting taskStatus Triggers

**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Open
**Category**: Release Management System
**Affects**: Automatic release detection and version management

---

## Problem Summary

The release management system is not detecting completion documents when tasks are marked complete using the `taskStatus` tool. This results in the release analyzer finding "0 completion documents" despite multiple completion documents being present in the repository.

## Observed Behavior

### What Happened

1. **Task Completion**: Completed Task 7 (Validate Cross-Platform Generation) for the Layering Token System spec
2. **Used taskStatus Tool**: Marked task complete using `taskStatus` tool as recommended
3. **Created Completion Documents**: Generated 20 completion documents in `.kiro/specs/layering-token-system/completion/`
4. **Ran Release Analysis**: Executed `npm run release:analyze`
5. **Result**: Release analyzer reported "0 completion documents" found

### Expected Behavior

The release management system should:
1. Detect when `taskStatus` tool marks a task as complete
2. Trigger the release detection agent hook
3. Scan for completion documents in the spec's completion directory
4. Create release trigger files
5. Analyze completion documents for version bump determination
6. Generate appropriate release notes

### Actual Behavior

- Release analyzer finds 0 completion documents
- No release triggers created for layering-token-system completion
- No version bump calculated
- No release notes generated
- Release manager log shows no entries for October 28, 2025 layering-token-system completion

## Evidence

### Completion Documents Present

```bash
$ find .kiro/specs/layering-token-system/completion -name "*completion.md" | wc -l
20
```

**20 completion documents exist** in the layering-token-system spec.

### Release Analyzer Output

```bash
$ npm run release:analyze

üìà Bump type: none
üéØ Confidence: 10.0%

```

### Release Manager Log

Last entry in `.kiro/logs/release-manager.log`:
```
[2025-10-28 18:01:04] Release manager hook started: hook_type=auto, source_path=
[2025-10-28 18:01:04] Detecting release triggers: type=spec-completion, source=/Users/3fn/Documents/Work Projects/Kiro/DesignerPunk-v2/.kiro/specs/afternoon-to-dusk-rename/completion/task-1-2-completion.md
```

**No entry for layering-token-system completion** despite using `taskStatus` tool.

### Release Triggers

```bash
$ ls -la .kiro/release-triggers/ | tail -3
-rw-r--r--@  1 3fn  staff  1117 Oct 28 17:56 1761699364-spec-completion.json
-rw-r--r--@  1 3fn  staff  1117 Oct 28 18:01 1761699664-spec-completion.json
```

**No new release trigger files** created for layering-token-system completion.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Hypothesis

The release detection agent hook (`.kiro/agent-hooks/release-detection-on-task-completion.json`) is configured to trigger on `taskStatusChange` events, but it appears the hook is not executing when the `taskStatus` tool is used.

### Configuration Review

**Agent Hook Config** (`.kiro/agent-hooks/release-detection-on-task-completion.json`):
```json
{
  "name": "Release Detection on Task Completion",
  "trigger": {
    "type": "taskStatusChange",
    "status": "completed"
  },
  "settings": {
    "requireConfirmation": false,
    "autoApprove": true,
    "runAfter": ["organize-after-task-completion"]
  }
}
```

**Release Config** (`.kiro/release-config.json`):
```json
{
  "detection": {
    "specCompletionTrigger": true,
    "taskCompletionTrigger": true,
    "monitorPaths": [
      ".kiro/specs/*/completion/",
      ".kiro/specs/*/tasks.md"
    ],
    "completionPatterns": [
      "*-completion.md",
      "spec-completion-summary.md"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Possible Causes

1. **Hook Not Executing**: The `taskStatusChange` event may not be triggering the agent hook
2. **Hook Chain Dependency**: Release detection depends on `organize-after-task-completion` running first
3. **Event Propagation**: The `taskStatus` tool may not be emitting the expected event
4. **Hook Registration**: The agent hook may not be properly registered with Kiro IDE
5. **Path Resolution**: The release manager may not be resolving completion document paths correctly

## Impact

### Immediate Impact

- **No Automatic Release Detection**: Completed specs don't trigger release analysis
- **Manual Release Process Required**: Must manually create releases on GitHub
- **No Version Management**: Version bumps not calculated automatically
- **No Release Notes**: Release notes not generated from completion documents
- **Lost Automation Value**: The entire release management system is non-functional

### Long-Term Impact

- **Process Friction**: Adds manual steps to what should be automated workflow
- **Inconsistent Releases**: Without automated analysis, releases may be inconsistent
- **Documentation Disconnect**: Completion documents not connected to releases
- **Reduced Confidence**: Can't trust the release management system to work correctly

## Workaround

### Current Workaround

1. **Manual Release Creation**: Create releases manually on GitHub
2. **Manual Version Bumps**: Determine version bumps manually based on completion documents
3. **Manual Release Notes**: Write release notes manually from completion documents
4. **Manual Trigger**: Run `./.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto` manually after task completion

### Manual Trigger Command

```bash
# After completing a task with taskStatus tool
./.kiro/hooks/release-manager.sh auto
```

This manually triggers release detection, but defeats the purpose of automation.

## Recommended Fix

### Investigation Steps

1. **Verify Hook Registration**: Confirm the release detection agent hook is registered with Kiro IDE
2. **Test Event Emission**: Verify that `taskStatus` tool emits `taskStatusChange` events
3. **Check Hook Execution**: Add logging to confirm when agent hooks execute
4. **Validate Hook Chain**: Ensure `organize-after-task-completion` runs before release detection
5. **Test Path Resolution**: Verify release manager can find completion documents in monitored paths

### Potential Solutions

1. **Fix Hook Trigger**: Ensure `taskStatusChange` events properly trigger the agent hook
2. **Add Fallback Detection**: Implement file system watching as fallback if hooks don't fire
3. **Improve Logging**: Add comprehensive logging to track hook execution and event flow
4. **Manual Trigger Integration**: Make manual trigger more accessible (e.g., command palette)
5. **Hook Debugging Tools**: Create tools to test and debug agent hook execution

### Testing Criteria

A fix should satisfy these criteria:

1. ‚úÖ Using `taskStatus` tool triggers release detection agent hook
2. ‚úÖ Release manager log shows entry for task completion
3. ‚úÖ Release trigger files created in `.kiro/release-triggers/`
4. ‚úÖ Release analyzer finds completion documents
5. ‚úÖ Version bump calculated correctly
6. ‚úÖ Release notes generated from completion documents

## Context

### When This Was Discovered

- **Date**: October 28, 2025
- **Spec**: Layering Token System (`.kiro/specs/layering-token-system/`)
- **Task**: Task 7 - Validate Cross-Platform Generation
- **Completion Documents**: 20 documents created across all 7 tasks
- **Expected Outcome**: Automatic release detection and version bump to 1.1.0 (minor bump for new feature)
- **Actual Outcome**: No detection, no version bump, no release notes

### Previous Successful Detections

The release manager log shows successful detections for:
- October 22, 2025: Cross-Platform Build System
- October 24, 2025: Border Width Tokens (multiple detections)
- October 28, 2025: Afternoon to Dusk Rename

**Key Difference**: These may have been triggered by file creation events, not `taskStatus` tool events.

## Priority Justification

**High Priority** because:

1. **Core Workflow Broken**: Release management is a core part of the development workflow
2. **Automation Lost**: The entire purpose of the release management system is automation
3. **Manual Overhead**: Requires significant manual work to create releases
4. **Quality Risk**: Manual processes are error-prone and inconsistent
5. **System Trust**: Can't trust the release management system to work correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Document Issue**: ‚úÖ Complete (this document)
2. **Create Bug Hunting Spec**: Include this issue in upcoming bug/issue hunting spec
3. **Investigate Root Cause**: Determine why `taskStatus` events don't trigger hooks
4. **Implement Fix**: Fix the hook trigger mechanism
5. **Test Fix**: Verify fix works with `taskStatus` tool
6. **Update Documentation**: Document the fix and any workflow changes
