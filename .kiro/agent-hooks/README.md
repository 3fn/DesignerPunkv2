# Kiro Agent Hooks

**Date**: January 10, 2025  
**Purpose**: Automated workflows triggered by Kiro IDE events  
**Organization**: process-standard  
**Scope**: cross-project  
**Integration**: Kiro IDE native hook system

---

## Agent Hook Overview

This directory contains Kiro Agent Hooks that automatically execute workflows in response to IDE events. These hooks integrate with Kiro's native automation capabilities while maintaining human control and quality assurance.

### Available Agent Hooks

#### 1. Task Completion File Organization
**File**: `organize-after-task.sh`  
**Trigger**: Task status changes to "completed"  
**Purpose**: Automatically organize files based on **Organization** metadata

**Workflow**:
1. Detect task completion event
2. Check for files needing organization based on metadata
3. Show preview of files that would be organized
4. Prompt user for confirmation
5. Organize files and update cross-references
6. Commit and push organization changes

**Safety Features**:
- Human confirmation required before organizing files
- Dry-run preview shows what will be organized
- Metadata validation before attempting organization
- Cross-reference integrity maintained automatically
- Fallback to manual organization always available

## Integration with Kiro IDE

### Hook Configuration

#### JSON Configuration (`task-completion-organization.json`)
```json
{
  "name": "Task Completion File Organization",
  "description": "Automatically organize files based on metadata when tasks are completed",
  "trigger": {
    "type": "taskStatus", 
    "condition": "status_changed_to_completed"
  },
  "action": {
    "type": "agent_execution",
    "script": ".kiro/agent-hooks/organize-after-task.sh"
  },
  "settings": {
    "auto_approve": false,
    "require_confirmation": true,
    "timeout_minutes": 10
  }
}
```

#### Markdown Documentation (`auto-organize-on-task-completion.md`)
Comprehensive documentation of the hook workflow, integration points, and troubleshooting guidance.

### Kiro IDE Integration Steps

1. **Hook Registration**: Kiro IDE automatically detects hooks in `.kiro/agent-hooks/`
2. **Event Monitoring**: Kiro monitors for task status changes
3. **Trigger Execution**: When task completes, hook is automatically triggered
4. **Agent Execution**: Kiro agent executes the organization workflow
5. **User Interaction**: Agent prompts user for confirmation as needed
6. **Completion**: Organization changes committed and pushed automatically

## Hook Development Principles

### Process-First Tool Development
- **Manual Process Proven**: File organization process validated manually first
- **Hook Enhancement**: Automation enhances proven processes rather than replacing them
- **Human Control**: User confirmation required for all organization actions
- **Fallback Available**: Manual organization always available as backup

### Safety and Quality Assurance
- **Metadata Validation**: Validate organization metadata before attempting moves
- **Interactive Confirmation**: User must approve organization before execution
- **Cross-Reference Integrity**: Automatically update links after file moves
- **Git Integration**: Commit organization changes with descriptive messages

### Integration with Existing Workflow
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing task completion workflow
- **Non-Disruptive**: User can skip organization if desired
- **Quality Maintenance**: Maintains File Organization Standards automatically
- **Scalable Approach**: Works as project grows and more specs are created

---

## Usage and Testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test the organization hook directly
./.kiro/agent-hooks/organize-after-task.sh

# Test with help information
./.kiro/agent-hooks/organize-after-task.sh --help
```

### Integration Testing
1. Complete a task that creates new files with organization metadata
2. Mark task as completed using `taskStatus` tool
3. Verify agent hook triggers automatically
4. Confirm organization workflow executes correctly
5. Validate files are organized and cross-references updated

### Troubleshooting
- **Hook Not Triggering**: Check Kiro IDE hook configuration and registration
- **Organization Failures**: Verify metadata format and organization hook availability
- **Cross-Reference Issues**: Check file paths and link update logic
- **Git Commit Problems**: Verify git status and repository permissions

## Benefits and Outcomes

### Immediate Benefits
- **Automatic Organization**: Files organized immediately after task completion
- **Clean Project Structure**: Prevents accumulation of unorganized files
- **Maintained Quality**: Cross-reference integrity preserved automatically
- **Reduced Manual Work**: Organization happens with minimal user intervention

### Long-Term Benefits
- **Scalable Organization**: Pattern works as project grows
- **Consistent Application**: Organization standards applied automatically
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Framework artifacts properly separated
- **Developer Experience**: Clean, navigable project structure maintained

### Success Metrics
- **Organization Rate**: Percentage of tasks that trigger successful organization
- **User Adoption**: Frequency of users confirming vs. skipping organization
- **Quality Maintenance**: Cross-reference integrity maintained through automation
- **Time Savings**: Reduction in manual organization effort

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Smart Metadata Detection**: Suggest organization metadata for files without it
- **Batch Organization**: Organize multiple files from different tasks together
- **Organization Analytics**: Track organization patterns and effectiveness
- **Integration Expansion**: Extend to other IDE events beyond task completion

### Integration Opportunities
- **Spec Creation**: Automatically organize files during spec development
- **File Creation**: Prompt for organization metadata when creating new files
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Automatically validate links during development
- **Quality Gates**: Integrate organization checks into quality assurance workflows
