purpose: "Provide a compact interactive element for selections, filters, or actions in horizontal groups."

usage:
  when_to_use:
    - "Base chip behavior shared across filter and input chip variants"
    - "Simple interactive chip without specialized filter or input semantics"
  when_not_to_use:
    - "Filtering content by toggling criteria — use Chip-Filter"
    - "Representing user-entered values that can be dismissed — use Chip-Input"
    - "Non-interactive labels — use Badge-Label-Base"

contexts:
  - "filter-bars"
  - "selection-groups"
  - "content-tags"

alternatives:
  - component: Chip-Filter
    reason: "When the chip toggles a content filter on/off"
  - component: Chip-Input
    reason: "When the chip represents a dismissible user-entered value"
  - component: Badge-Label-Base
    reason: "When the element is non-interactive and display-only"
