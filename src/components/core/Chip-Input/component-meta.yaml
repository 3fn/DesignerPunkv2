usage:
  when_to_use:
    - "Displaying tags or selections the user has entered or chosen"
    - "Email recipient chips in compose fields"
    - "Removable filter selections in search interfaces"
  when_not_to_use:
    - "Toggling content filters — use Chip-Filter"
    - "Non-interactive labels — use Badge-Label-Base"

contexts:
  - "tag-inputs"
  - "email-compose"
  - "multi-select-fields"
  - "search-refinements"

alternatives:
  - component: Chip-Filter

  - component: Chip-Base
    reason: "When generic chip behavior is needed without dismiss semantics"
