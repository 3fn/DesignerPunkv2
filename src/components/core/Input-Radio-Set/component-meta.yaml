    - "Form fields requiring exactly one selection from multiple options"
    - "Settings where choices are mutually exclusive (e.g., theme, language)"
  when_not_to_use:

    - "Action-driven vertical menus — use Button-VerticalList-Set"

contexts:
  - "forms"
  - "settings-screens"
  - "preference-panels"
  - "onboarding-flows"

alternatives:
