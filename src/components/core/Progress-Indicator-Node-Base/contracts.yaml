  renders_state_colors:
    category: visual
    description: Applies correct color tokens based on node state
    behavior: |
      Each state maps to semantic color.progress.* tokens:
      - incomplete: pending.background / pending.text
      - current: current.background / current.text
      - completed: completed.background / completed.text
      - error: error.background / error.text
    wcag: "1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)"
    platforms: [web, ios, android]
    validation:
      - Background color matches state token
      - Foreground color matches state token
      - Colors use design tokens, not hardcoded values

  applies_size_emphasis:
    category: visual
    description: Current state renders at +4px emphasized size
    behavior: |
      Nodes use base size for incomplete/completed/error states
      and current size (+4px) for current state:
      - sm: 12px base → 16px current
      - md: 16px base → 20px current
      - lg: 24px base → 28px current
    wcag: "1.4.11 Non-text Contrast"
    platforms: [web, ios, android]
    validation:
      - Non-current states render at base size
      - Current state renders at current size (+4px)
      - Size values match component tokens

  renders_content:
    category: content
    description: Renders appropriate content based on size and content prop
    behavior: |
      - sm: always renders as filled dot (content prop ignored)
      - md/lg + none: empty circle
      - md/lg + checkmark: checkmark icon
      - md/lg + icon: specified icon
    platforms: [web, ios, android]
    validation:
      - sm always shows dot regardless of content prop
      - md/lg shows correct content type
      - Checkmark renders for completed nodes

  respects_reduced_motion:
    category: accessibility
    description: Size transitions respect prefers-reduced-motion
    behavior: |
      When transitioning between states (and thus sizes), the animation
      is disabled when the user has prefers-reduced-motion enabled.
    wcag: "2.3.3 Animation from Interactions"
    platforms: [web, ios, android]
    validation:
      - Transitions animate by default
      - Transitions are instant with prefers-reduced-motion

  decorative_primitive:
    category: accessibility
    description: Primitive is decorative; semantic variants handle a11y
    behavior: |
      Node-Base is marked as decorative (aria-hidden on web,
      accessibilityHidden on iOS, clearAndSetSemantics on Android).
      Semantic variants provide ARIA roles and labels.
    platforms: [web, ios, android]
    validation:
      - Node has aria-hidden="true" (web)
      - Node is hidden from assistive technology
