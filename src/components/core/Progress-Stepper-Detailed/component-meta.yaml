purpose: "Guide users through a multi-step workflow with labeled nodes, step descriptions, and connector lines showing full progress detail."

usage:
  when_to_use:
    - "Complex multi-step flows where each step needs a description"
    - "Workflows where visual connectors between steps aid comprehension"
    - "When users need to understand what each step involves before reaching it"
  when_not_to_use:
    - "Simple step indicators with labels only — use Progress-Stepper-Base"
    - "Dot-based pagination — use Progress-Pagination-Base"

contexts:
  - "checkout-flows"
  - "application-forms"
  - "onboarding-flows"
  - "setup-wizards"

alternatives:
  - component: Progress-Stepper-Base
    reason: "When step labels are sufficient without descriptions or connector lines"
  - component: Progress-Pagination-Base
    reason: "When simple dot indicators are sufficient"
