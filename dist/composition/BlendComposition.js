 *
 * Defines types for blend composition patterns where blend modifications are applied to colors.
 * Supports "color with blend direction" syntax for compositional color modification effects.
 *
 * Examples:
 * - "purple500 with blend200 darker" → purple500 darkened by 8%
 * - "blue500 with blend300 lighter" → blue500 lightened by 12%
 * - "red500 with blend200 saturate" → red500 with 8% more saturation
 * - "gray500 with blend300 desaturate" → gray500 with 12% less saturation
