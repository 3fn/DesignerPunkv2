/**
 * Opacity Composition Types
 *
 * Defines types for opacity composition patterns where opacity is applied to colors.
 * Supports "color at opacity" syntax for compositional transparency effects.
 *
 * Examples:
 * - "purple500 at opacity600" → purple500 with 48% opacity
 * - "black500 at opacityOverlay" → black500 with 32% opacity (semantic)
 * - "white100 at opacity1000" → white100 with 80% opacity
