## Dependency Analysis Methodology

### Customer Needs + Brand Goals Framework Application

**Customer Need Priority**: Systems that directly enable predictable cross-platform development experience
**Brand Goal Priority**: Systems that establish architectural leadership and demonstrate mathematical innovation

**Dependency Classification**:
- **Foundational**: Systems that other systems require to function (highest priority)
- **Enabling**: Systems that significantly improve other systems' effectiveness
- **Supporting**: Systems that enhance functionality but aren't required for basic operation
- **Independent**: Systems that can operate without dependencies on other systems

### Dependency Relationship Types

**Hard Dependencies**: System B cannot function without System A
**Soft Dependencies**: System B is significantly enhanced by System A but can function independently
**Integration Points**: Systems that must coordinate but don't depend on each other
**Parallel Development**: Systems that can be developed simultaneously without conflicts

**Resource Allocation**: Foundational systems require highest quality resources and longest development time
**Risk Management**: Foundational system failures have cascading effects across entire system

### Parallel Development Strategy

**Maximum Parallelization**: Three independent tracks can develop simultaneously after foundational systems
**Resource Optimization**: Different skill sets can work on different tracks without conflicts
**Integration Planning**: Integration points must be planned early to prevent conflicts

### Customer Value Delivery

**Early Value**: Foundational systems provide immediate customer value through mathematical consistency and cross-platform functionality
**Incremental Enhancement**: Supporting systems add value incrementally without disrupting core functionality
**Quality Assurance**: Quality systems validate and optimize customer experience throughout development
