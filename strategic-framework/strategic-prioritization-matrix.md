## Alternative Sequencing Approaches Considered

### Alternative 1: Customer Value First
**Approach**: Prioritize systems that deliver immediate customer value
**Sequence**: F1 â†’ F3 â†’ D1 â†’ F2 â†’ Others
**Rejected Because**: F3 requires F2 for platform separation, creates dependency conflicts
**Trade-offs**: Faster initial customer value but higher integration risk

### Alternative 2: Risk Mitigation First
**Approach**: Prioritize highest-risk systems to validate feasibility early
**Sequence**: F1 â†’ F3 â†’ F2 â†’ D1 â†’ Others
**Rejected Because**: F3 requires F2, creates impossible dependency sequence
**Trade-offs**: Early risk validation but dependency violations

### Alternative 3: Parallel Maximum
**Approach**: Maximize parallel development across all systems
**Sequence**: All systems start simultaneously with integration points
**Rejected Because**: Hard dependencies prevent parallel development, creates integration chaos
**Trade-offs**: Maximum resource utilization but high integration failure risk

### Alternative 4: Minimal Viable First
**Approach**: Build minimal version of all systems, then enhance
**Sequence**: Minimal F1 â†’ Minimal F2 â†’ Minimal F3 â†’ Enhancement cycles
**Rejected Because**: Minimal systems may not provide sufficient foundation for dependents
**Trade-offs**: Faster initial delivery but potential rework and instability

### Chosen Approach Rationale
**Dependency-Informed Sequential with Parallel Optimization**:
- Respects hard dependencies to prevent development conflicts
- Maximizes parallel development where dependencies allow
- Balances customer value delivery with technical feasibility
- Provides clear success criteria and risk mitigation strategies
- Enables resource optimization through skill set overlap and sequential reuse
