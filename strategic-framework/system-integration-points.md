## Integration Point Identification Methodology

### Resolved System Dependency Chain

**Foundation Layer**: F1 → F3 → F2 (Token + Translation → Component → Build)
- **F1 (Mathematical Token System + Translation Providers)**: Generates platform-specific semantic token constants through integrated Translation Providers
- **F3 (Component Architecture Framework)**: Consumes pre-generated platform-specific token constants during development
- **F2 (Cross-Platform Build System)**: Selects appropriate platform token files and packages component implementations

**Build System Role**: Packaging and optimization layer rather than foundational dependency

### Integration Point Classification

**Critical Integration Points**: System boundaries where failure would cascade across multiple systems
**High Priority Integration Points**: Important coordination areas that significantly impact system effectiveness
**Standard Integration Points**: Necessary coordination that can be handled through established patterns

## Critical Integration Points

### IP-1: Mathematical Token + Translation → Component Architecture Integration

**Systems**: F1 (Mathematical Token System + Translation Providers) → F3 (Component Architecture Framework)
**Integration Type**: Hard dependency with pre-generated platform-specific constants
**Priority**: Critical - Foundation of all component development

**Integration Requirements**:
- **Platform-Specific Token Generation**: F1 Translation Providers generate platform-specific constants (DesignTokens.web.js, DesignTokens.ios.swift, DesignTokens.android.kt) before component development
- **Primitive and Semantic Token Support**: F1 handles both primitive tokens (space100 = 8) and semantic tokens (spacing.standard = @space100) through Translation Providers
- **Translation Provider Integration**: Unit Providers, Format Providers, and Path Providers work within F1 to convert any token type to platform formats
- **Cross-Platform Mathematical Consistency**: Token constants maintain mathematical relationships across all platform implementations through Translation Provider coordination

**Integration Challenges**:
- **Translation Provider Coordination**: F1 must coordinate multiple Translation Providers (Unit, Format, Path) to generate complete platform-specific constants
- **Token Type Handling**: F1 Translation Providers must handle both primitive and semantic tokens appropriately for each platform
- **Platform Format Consistency**: Translation Providers must maintain mathematical relationships while converting to platform-native formats
- **Development Environment Integration**: Component development tools must have access to pre-generated platform-specific token constants

**Integration Success Criteria**:
- F1 Translation Providers generate complete platform-specific token files for all target platforms
- Components can import and use platform-optimized token constants (space075, spacing.standard) during development
