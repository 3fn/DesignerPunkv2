## Test Content

This is a test file created to demonstrate the Kiro Agent Hook automatic file organization system. 

When a task is completed, this file should be automatically detected and moved to the `strategic-framework/` directory based on its **Organization**: framework-strategic metadata.

### Expected Behavior

1. Agent hook detects task completion
2. Scans for files with organization metadata
3. Finds this file needs to be moved to strategic-framework/
4. Prompts user for confirmation
5. Moves file and updates any cross-references
6. Commits the organization changes

This demonstrates the complete automation workflow while maintaining human control and safety features.
