## Strategic Framework Overview

This consolidated framework integrates the complete strategic foundation for fresh repository development, combining:

1. **North Star Vision**: Clear success definition integrating preserved architectural knowledge
2. **Supporting Systems Catalog**: High-level system inventory with purposes and dependencies  
3. **Strategic Prioritization**: Dependencies and sequencing for maximum effectiveness
4. **Knowledge Gaps Resolution**: Process-first approach to uncertainty management
5. **Coordination Framework**: System relationship mapping and integration guidance

### Framework Philosophy Integration

**Process-First Tool Development**: Establish clear needs through proven processes before creating tools to enhance those processes, leveraging Kiro's steering and hooks capabilities for automation of proven patterns

**Parallel Development Strategy**: Systems develop simultaneously with preliminary guidelines refined during implementation, enabling velocity while maintaining quality

**Skepticism Default with Progressive Relaxation**: Architectural decisions require skepticism protocols with progressive relaxation as foundations solidify through proven implementation

**Two-Layer Cross-Platform Consistency**: API consistency required across platforms, platform-native differences encouraged when appropriate with proper documentation

### Translation Provider Architecture Integration

**Business Localization Model**: The design token ecosystem operates like a global business with consistent brand representation across markets (platforms) while respecting local conventions

**Translation Provider Services** (Language Translators coordinated by F2 Build System):
- **Unit Providers**: Convert dimensional expertise (space100: 8 → 0.5rem, 8.0pt, 8.dp) based on target platform
- **Format Providers**: Convert color expertise (colorRed100: #B80F0A → UIColor, Color) for platform-native formats  
- **Path Providers**: Convert asset expertise (icon-name → SVG, SF Symbol, Vector) for platform assets
- **Animation Providers**: Convert motion expertise (duration: 300 → 300ms, TimeInterval, duration) for platform animations

**Build System as Cultural Translator**: F2 coordinates Translation Providers at build time when target platform is known, ensuring F1 mathematical expertise becomes platform-optimized constants for F3 consumption

**Dependency Chain Resolution**: F1 (Remote Workers) → Translation Providers (Language Translators) → F2 (Cultural Translator) → F3 (Local Operations)

## Narrative Alignment Resolution

### Key Misalignments Addressed
