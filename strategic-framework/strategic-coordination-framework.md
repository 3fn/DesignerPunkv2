## Coordination Framework Philosophy

### Business Localization Coordination Model

**Foundation**: Coordination operates on a **business localization model** where design tokens are **remote workers with specialized expertise** serving **multiple markets (platforms)** through **translation services**. See [Complete Token Ecosystem Narrative](complete-token-ecosystem-narrative.md) for full business context.

**Coordination Principle**: Each system focuses on core expertise while coordination ensures seamless integration without creating bottlenecks, following the resolved **Option A architecture** documented in [Narrative to Production Analysis](narrative-to-production-analysis.md).

### Process-First Tool Development Strategy

**Core Principle**: Establish clear needs through proven processes before creating tools to enhance those processes

**Tool Development Approach**:
- **Need Identification**: Tools created only after process limitations are clearly identified through real-world usage
- **Process Enhancement**: Tools enhance proven processes rather than replace unproven ones
- **Steering and Hooks Integration**: Leverage Kiro's steering and hooks capabilities to offload repetitive tasks once patterns are established
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with manual processes, identify repetitive/cumbersome tasks, then create tools to automate proven patterns

**Anti-Pattern Prevention**:
- No tools created based on theoretical needs or assumptions
- No over-engineered tooling that exceeds the effort of manual resolution
- No tools that create more complexity than they solve
- No automated systems without proven manual processes as foundation

### Parallel Development with Preliminary Guidelines

**Development Strategy**: Systems can develop simultaneously with preliminary guidelines that are refined during implementation

**Coordination Benefits**:
- **Velocity**: Parallel development prevents sequential bottlenecks
- **Real-World Validation**: Guidelines refined through actual implementation experience
- **Risk Mitigation**: Preliminary guidelines provide direction while allowing course correction
- **Resource Optimization**: Teams can work simultaneously rather than waiting for perfect specifications

**Refinement Process**:
- Start with preliminary guidelines based on preserved knowledge and strategic direction
- Track guideline effectiveness during parallel development
- Update guidelines based on real-world implementation challenges and successes
- Document refinement rationale for future reference

### Skepticism Default with Progressive Relaxation

**Architectural Decision Skepticism**: Default to skepticism protocols for decisions with broad system impact

**Skepticism Required For**:
- System boundary definitions and changes
- Cross-platform consistency requirements and validation approaches
- Mathematical foundation modifications and extensions
- Integration pattern establishment and evolution
- Naming convention decisions and standards

**Progressive Relaxation Criteria**:
- **Foundation Confidence**: As architectural decisions become proven through implementation
- **Pattern Establishment**: When coordination patterns are validated through repeated successful application
- **Risk Assessment**: Lower-risk decisions can shift to standard collaboration sooner
- **Explicit Consent Required**: Relaxation only begins with explicit human consent after agreeing to what the relaxed position would entail
